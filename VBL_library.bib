  abstract = {Endophytic microorganisms are fungi or bacteria which live inside plant tissues or organs, without causing them any harmful symptoms. Indeed, since many are also able to produce substances of biotechnological interest, they may protect the plant from insect attacks and diseases. The date palm, Phoenix dactylifera \{(Linnaeus)\} is a tree which has been known in Saudi Arabia for thousands of years as a staple food. The aim of the present work was to investigate the inhibitory activity of crude extracts of the fungal endophyte Cochliobolus spicifer \{(Nelson),\} isolated from the date palm, against Aedes caspius \{(Pallas)\} and Culex pipiens \{(Linnaeus)\} larvae. In addition, histological changes were determined in the digestive system of treated third instar larvae. The data showed that C. spicifer interfered with the developmental cycle of the mosquito, and had its strongest toxic effect (with 100\textasciitilde\% mortality in third instar larvae) at concentrations of 300\textasciitilde ppm. This compound did not show toxicity to zebrafish. The third instar larvae treated with the active fraction showed cellular destruction and disorganization, cell spacing, and vacuolization of epithelial cells in small regions of the midgut. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to report the isolation of endophytic fungi C. spicifer from date palm trees \{(P.\} dactylifera). The endophytic fungal extract of C. spicifer proved to be a strong candidate for a natural, safe, and stable phytolarvicidal to be used in population control of Ae. caspius and Cx. pipiens.},

Most strains were annotated as Rhizopus, Fusarium, Penicillium, Cochliobolus, and Artomyces spp. by the sequence of their 18S rRNA gene. In vitro confrontation assays between endophytes and three pathogens (the bacteria Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae and Enterobacter sp. strain FCB1, and the fungus Colletotrichum lindemuthianum) revealed strong and mainly symmetric reciprocal effects: endophyte and pathogen either mutually inhibited (mainly Enterobacter FCB1 and Colletotrichum) or facilitated (P. syringae) the growth of each other. In planta, the endophytes had a strong inhibitory effect on P. syringae when they colonized the plant before the bacterium, whereas infection was facilitated when P. syringae colonized the plant before the endophyte. Infection with Enterobacter FCB1 was facilitated when the bacterium colonized the plant before or on the same day with the endophyte, but not when the endophyte was present before the bacterium. The order of arrival determines whether fungal endophytes enhance plant resistance to bacterial pathogens or facilitate disease.},

  abstract = {Although endophytic fungi are ubiquitous in plants, their full range of ecological effects has yet to be characterized, particularly in non-agronomic systems. In this study, we compared the responses of two congeneric bluegrass species to flooding. Both plant species co-occur in subalpine zones of the Rocky Mountains. Marsh bluegrass (Poa leptocoma) commonly hosts a vertically transmitted fungal endophyte (Epichloë sp.) and naturally grows in wetter conditions than does nodding bluegrass (Poa reflexa), which lacks an epichloid endophyte. We investigated the novel hypothesis that endophyte symbiosis promotes host fitness under flooded conditions, contributing to niche differentiation between the two bluegrass species. We used a factorial greenhouse experiment to test whether endophyte presence improved survival, growth, or reproduction of P. leptocoma under flooded versus non-flooded edaphic conditions by experimentally removing the endophyte from half of the plants. We compared P. leptocoma responses to those of the endophyte-free congener. In contrast to expectations generated from the natural distributions of the two plant species, endophyte presence was more beneficial to P. leptocoma under ambient soil moisture than under flooding. Increased benefits of symbiosis in drier soils are consistent with studies of other grass endophytes. Flooded soils also unexpectedly improved the growth of P. reflexa more than that of the wet habitat specialist, P. leptocoma. While our results demonstrate an overall benefit of fungal symbiosis in this system, ecological factors other than flooding per se likely underlie the observed geographical distributions of these congeneric grasses in nature.},

  abstract = {Plant-associated microorganisms have been shown to critically affect host physiology and performance, suggesting that evolution and ecology of plants and animals can only be understood in a holobiont (host and its associated organisms) context. Host-associated microbial community structures are affected by abiotic and host factors, and increased attention is given to the role of the microbiome in interactions such as pathogen inhibition. However, little is known about how these factors act on the microbial community, and espe-cially what role microbe–microbe interaction dynamics play. We have begun to address this knowledge gap for phyllosphere microbiomes of plants by simultaneously studying three major groups of Arabidopsis thaliana symbionts (bacteria, fungi and oomycetes) using a systems biology approach. We evaluated multiple potential factors of microbial community control: we sampled various wild A. thaliana populations at different times, performed field plantings with different host genotypes, and implemented successive host colonization experiments under lab conditions where abiotic factors, host genotype, and pathogen colo-nization was manipulated. Our results indicate that both abiotic factors and host genotype interact to affect plant colonization by all three groups of microbes. Considering microbe– microbe interactions, however, uncovered a network of interkingdom interactions with sig-nificant contributions to community structure. As in other scale-free networks, a small num-ber of taxa, which we call microbial " hubs, " are strongly interconnected and have a severe effect on communities. By documenting these microbe–microbe interactions, we uncover an important mechanism explaining how abiotic factors and host genotypic signatures con-trol microbial communities. In short, they act directly on " hub " microbes, which, via microbe– microbe interactions, transmit the effects to the microbial community. We analyzed two " hub " microbes (the obligate biotrophic oomycete pathogen Albugo and the basidiomycete yeast fungus Dioszegia) more closely. Albugo had strong effects on epiphytic and endo-phytic bacterial colonization. Specifically, alpha diversity decreased and beta diversity stabi-lized in the presence of Albugo infection, whereas they otherwise varied between plants. Dioszegia, on the other hand, provided evidence for direct hub interaction with phyllosphere bacteria. The identification of microbial " hubs " and their importance in phyllosphere micro-biome structuring has crucial implications for plant–pathogen and microbe–microbe}

Fungal samples were collected from 10 half-sibling families of mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) grown in two environmental conditions with different daily average temperatures: a forested river valley and an adjacent open tundra (altitudinal difference 180 in). Genetic analysis of V. ditricha isolates was done using random amplified microsatellite polymerase chain reaction. We found that host genotypes, along with prevailing environmental conditions, influence the probability of infection by particular endophyte genotypes. The most susceptible host genotypes were highly infected with genetically similar endophyte genotypes, whereas the most resistant trees were poorly infected and they were infected by genetically dissimilar endophytes. Our results also showed environment-host genotype interactions, suggesting that the susceptibility of the host to a particular endophyte genotype may change in natural environments when environmental conditions are changed. It appears, that a particular endophyte genotype needs to find the right host genotype for a successful infection. There are many host genotypes in natural stands; this means, from the point of view of the fungus, the environment is heterogeneous. Thus, under the influence of birch tree genotypes, genetically differentiated subgroups of the endophytic fungus may be formed in different environments.},

Fungal richness did not vary by host plant species or across live versus dead stems. However, there was a strong effect of the portion of the plant sampled, with lower stems and leaves harboring the greatest numbers of fungal taxa. Despite the similarity in overall richness across host species, there were differences in fungal composition by plant species, field site, and portion of the plant sampled. Root fungal communities showed the greatest divergence across both host plant species and field sites, consistent with expectations of lower dispersal in belowground communities. Our results confirm that salt marsh plants host diverse fungal communities both above-and belowground.},

  abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the marsh dieback events that have been observed along the east and gulf coasts of the U.S. over the past decade. It is likely that some of the recently reported changes in marsh vegetation were affected by physical or biotic disturbances that are known to generate bare areas, such as overgrazing or wrack smothering. Other areas may be experiencing a state change such as that caused by long-term changes in sea level. However, sites in many areas are not readily explained by these causes and are considered to have experienced "sudden dieback." In such cases, there are observations that the above-ground plant material thinned or browned or, in some cases, failed to re-emerge in the spring; the dieback occurred over a period of months and usually affected multiple sites within the area; and there is evidence that these events are transient (through successful transplants or natural regrowth/recovery), although some areas take years to recover. We explored the potential linkage of dieback with drought (as characterized by the Palmer Severity Drought Index), and found that there is evidence for an association in the southeast (GA and SC) and the Gulf (LA), but not in the mid-Atlantic (DE, VA) or northeast (ME, RI, CT). We also review the evidence for potential causes of sudden dieback, including changes in soil chemistry, fungal pathogens, top-down consumer controls, and multiple stressors. There is currently no single explanation that can be applied to recent dieback. We highlight the need for the development of improved diagnostics that will allow us to better classify dieback areas and provide evidence for (or against) potential causes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.},

We conducted demographic surveys of leaf age composition, and measured the age dependence of leaf physiology in broadleaf canopy trees of abundant species at a central eastern Amazon site. Using a novel leaf-to-branch scaling approach, we used these data to independently test the much-debated hypothesis – arising from satellite and tower-based observations – that leaf phenology could explain the forest-scale pattern of dry season photosynthesis. Stomatal conductance and biochemical parameters of photosynthesis were higher for recently mature leaves than for old leaves. Most branches had multiple leaf age categories simultaneously present, and the number of recently mature leaves increased as the dry season progressed because old leaves were exchanged for new leaves. These findings provide the first direct field evidence that branch-scale photosynthetic capacity increases during the dry season, with a magnitude consistent with increases in ecosystem-scale photosynthetic capacity derived from flux towers. Interactions between leaf age-dependent physiology and shifting leaf age-demographic composition are sufficient to explain the dry season photosynthetic capacity pattern at this site, and should be considered in vegetation models of tropical evergreen forests.},

We assessed plants from oil-affected and unaffected populations using a custom DNA microarray to identify genomewide transcription patterns and gene expression networks that respond to crude oil exposure. In addition, we used T-DNA insertion lines of the model grass Brachypodium distachyon to assess the contribution of four novel candidate genes to crude oil response. Responses in S. alterniflora to hydrocarbon exposure across the transcriptome as well as xenobiotic specific response pathways had little overlap with those previously identified in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Among T-DNA insertion lines of B. distachyon, we found additional support for two candidate genes, one (ATTPS21) involved in volatile production, and the other (SUVH5) involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression, that may be important in the response to crude oil. The architecture of crude oil response in S. alterniflora is unique from that of the model species A. thali-ana, suggesting that xenobiotic response may be highly variable across plant species. In addition, further investigations of regulatory networks may benefit from more information about epigenetic response pathways.},

  abstract = {Foundation species create complex habitats in which associated organisms find refuge from biological and physical stress; these foundation spe-cies are thus fundamental to the structure and resilience of terrestrial and marine ecosystems. In the present article, we develop an approach to understanding foundation species' effects in communities that are maintained not by a single foundation species, as has been the focus of research to date, but by multiple, co-occurring foundation species. Using examples from diverse ecosystems, we illustrate the prevalence of multiple-foundation-species assemblages and hypothesize that the nature of foundation-species interactions has important consequences for community structure. We predict where positive and negative interactions among foundation species will occur and suggest that they organize communities hierarchically in nested or adjacent assemblages that underlie landscape-scale patterns in species distribution. Elucidating the predictable nature of foundation-species interactions may be key to understanding and managing the biodiversity and functioning of many ecosystems. facultative effects of a single dominant, structure-forming space holder have been investigated. In coastal soft-sediment habitats, for instance, extensive beds of the seagrass Thalas-sia testudinum can cover otherwise low-productivity sand flats occupied by algae. By reducing water flow, modify-ing the substrate, and impeding the foraging efficiency of mobile predators, seagrass beds facilitate the settlement of benthic invertebrates and enhance the survivorship and den-sity of prey species (Orth et al. 1984, Heck et al. 2003, Canion and Heck 2009). Similarly, along thousands of kilometers of Caribbean coastline, networks of red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) roots provide essential nursery habitat for juvenile snappers, grunts, barracuda, and other fishes and physically guard these populations from larger predators (Beck et al. 2001, Faunce and Serafy 2008). Consequently, the trophic dynamics associated with seagrass and mangrove commu-nities arise largely from the biogenic framework provided by foundation species, which suggests a hierarchical com-munity organization in which species and their interspecific interactions occur within a community that is itself estab-lished with the facilitation of a foundation species (Bruno and Bertness 2001). Field experiments in which the presence of foundation species was manipulated or their physical attributes mimicked have elucidated the mechanisms by E},

In two sites in a lowland, moist tropical forest of central Panama, we quantified endophyte colonization patterns, richness, host preference, and spatial variation in healthy leaves of two co-occurring, understory tree species [Heisteria concinna (Olacaceae) and Ouratea lucens (Ochnaceae)]. From 83 leaves, all of which were colonized by endophytes, we isolated 418 endophyte morphospecies (estimated 347 genetically distinct taxa), most of which were represented by only a single isolate (59\%). Among morphospecies encountered in more than one leaf (nonsingletons), we found evidence of host preference and spatial heterogeneity using both morphospecies frequencies and presence/absence records. Based on these data, we postulate that tropical endophytes themselves may be hyperdiverse and suggest that extrapolative estimates that exclude them will markedly underestimate fungal species diversity.},

  abstract = {Every plant species examined to date harbors endophytic fungi within its asymptomatic aerial tissues, such that endophytes rep-resent a ubiquitous, yet cryptic, component of terrestrial plant communities. Fungal endophytes associated with leaves of woody angiosperms are especially diverse; yet, fundamental aspects of their interactions with hosts are unknown. In contrast to the relatively species-poor endophytes that are vertically transmitted and act as defensive mutualists of some temperate grasses, the diverse, horizontally transmitted endophytes of woody angio-sperms are thought to contribute little to host defense. Here, we document high diversity, spatial structure, and host affinity among foliar endophytes associated with a tropical tree (Theobroma cacao, Malvaceae) across lowland Panama. We then show that inoculation of endophyte-free leaves with endophytes isolated frequently from naturally infected, asymptomatic hosts signifi-cantly decreases both leaf necrosis and leaf mortality when T. cacao seedlings are challenged with a major pathogen (Phytophthora sp.). In contrast to reports of fungal inoculation inducing systemic defense, we found that protection was primarily localized to endophyte-infected tissues. Further, endophyte-mediated protec-tion was greater in mature leaves, which bear less intrinsic defense against fungal pathogens than do young leaves. In vitro studies suggest that host affinity is mediated by leaf chemistry, and that protection may be mediated by direct interactions of endophytes with foliar pathogens. Together, these data demonstrate the capacity of diverse, horizontally transmitted endophytes of woody angiosperms to play an important but previously unappreciated role in host defense.}

Microbial symbionts of plants profoundly influence host water relations (Lösch \& Gansert 2002), but are rarely considered in studies of tropical plant physiology. In particular, plant–fungus associations, which are ubiquitous in plant communities and especially common in tropical forests, play important and varied roles in plant water status. Fungal pathogens associated with roots, vascular tissue and foliage may interfere with water uptake and transport, increase rates of foliar transpiration, and induce xylem embolism and tissue death (Agrios 1997). In contrast, rhizosphere mutualists such as ecto- and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi may benefit hosts by increasing surface area for water uptake, enhancing stomatal regulation of water loss, and increasing root hydraulic conductivity (Auge 2001, Lösch \& Gansert 2002).},

The highest concentrations of oil were found in the top 2 cm of sediment nearest the waterline at the shorelines known to have been heavily oiled. Although petroleum hydrocarbons were detectable, Macondo oil could not be identified below 8 cm in 19 of the 20 surveyed sites. At the one site where oil was detected below 8 cm, concentrations were low. Residual Macondo oil was already highly weathered at the start of the study, and the concentrations of individual saturated hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons continued to decrease over the course of the study due to biodegradation. Desulfococcus oleovorans, Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus, Mycobacterium vanbaalenii, and related mycobacteria were the most abundant oil-degrading microorganisms detected in the top 2 cm at the oiled sites. Relative populations of these taxa declined as oil concentrations declined. The diversity of the microbial community was low at heavily oiled sites compared to that of the unoiled reference sites. As oil concentrations decreased over time, microbial diversity increased and approached the diversity levels of the reference sites. These trends show that the oil continues to be biodegraded, and microbial diversity continues to increase, indicating ongoing overall ecological recovery.}

  abstract = {The Deepwater Horizon oil spill was the largest marine oil spill in U.S. waters to date, and one of the largest worldwide. Impacts of this spill on salt marsh vegetation have been well documented, although impacts on marsh macroinvertebrates have received less attention. To examine impacts of the oil spill on an important marsh invertebrate and ecosystem engineer, we conducted a meta-analysis on fiddler crabs (Uca spp.) using published sources and newly available Natural Resources Damage Assessment (NRDA) and Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GoMRI) data. Fiddler crabs influence marsh ecosystem structure and function through their burrowing and feeding activities, and are key prey for a number of marsh and estuarine predators. We tested the hypotheses that the spill affected fiddler crab burrow density (crab abundance), burrow diameter (crab size), and crab species composition. Averaged across multiple studies, Powered by Editorial Manager® and ProduXion Manager® from Aries Systems Corporation sites, and years, our synthesis revealed a negative effect of oiling on all three metrics. Burrow densities were reduced by 39\% in oiled sites, with impacts and incomplete recovery observed over 2010-2014. Burrow diameters were reduced from 2010-2011, but appeared to have recovered by 2012. Fiddler crab species composition was altered through at least 2013, and only returned to reference conditions where marsh vegetation recovered, via restoration planting in one case. Given the spatial and temporal extent of data analyzed, this synthesis provides compelling evidence that the Deepwater Horizon spill suppressed populations of fiddler crabs in oiled marshes, likely affecting other ecosystem attributes, including marsh productivity, marsh soil characteristics, and associated predators.},

  abstract = {1. Most plants interact with both arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which increase nutrient acquisition, and herbivores such as aphids, which drain nutrients from plants. Both AM fungi and aphids can affect plant metabolic pathways and may influence each other by altering the condition of the shared host plant. 2. This study tests simultaneously the effects ofAMfungi on interactions with aphids (bottom-up effects) and the effects of aphids on interactions with AM fungi (top-down effects). We hypothe- sized that: (i) attractiveness of plants to aphids is regulated by induced changes in production of plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) triggered by AM fungi or aphids; (ii) aphids reduce AMfungal colonization; and (iii)AMfungal colonization affects aphid development. 3. Broad beans were exposed to AM fungi, aphids and a combination of both. To test for the strength of bottom-up and top-down effects, separate treatments enabled establishment of mycorrhizas either before or after aphids were added to plants. VOCs produced by plants were used to (i) test their attractiveness to aphids and (ii) identify the semiochemicals causing attrac- tion. We also measured plant growth and nutrition, AM fungal colonization and aphid reproduction. 4. AM fungi increased the attractiveness of plants to aphids, and this effect tended to prevail even for aphid-infested plants. However, both attractiveness and aphid population growth depended on the timing of AM fungal inoculation. AM fungi suppressed emission of the sesquiterpenes (E)-caryophyllene and (E)-b-farnesene, and aphid attractiveness to VOCs was negatively associated with the proportion of sesquiterpenes in the sample. Emission of (Z)-3- hexenyl acetate, naphthalene and (R)-germacrene D was regulated by an interaction between aphids and AM fungi. Aphids had a negative effect on mycorrhizal colonization, plant biomass and nutrition. 5. Our data show that below- and above-ground organisms can interact by altering the quality of their shared host plant even though there is no direct contact between them. Plant interactions with herbivores and AM fungi operate in both directions: AM fungi have a key bottom-up role in insect host location by increasing the attractiveness of plant VOCs to aphids, whereas aphids inhibit formation ofAMsymbioses.},

  abstract = {Fourth edition. In all subjects in science new findings and use of new technologies allow us to develop an ever-greater understanding of our world. With the evolution of molecular tools for identifying fungi and genomics to understand relationships between fungal species, the entire concept of fungal taxonomy has been changed from classical Linnean nomenclature to that of bar codes and robust multi-gene phylogenetic molecular trees (Hibbett and Taylor 2013, Money 2013). These tools allow us to ask new questions in relation to the evolution of the kingdom Fungi and the major taxa within. Along with this surge, the development of molecular tools in the application of genomics, metagenomics and transcriptomics has allowed us to understand more about the functional aspects of fungi in real time (Martin 2014). Fungi interact with all components of the ecosystems on earth, but do not act alone. Different fungi interact with each other and with other organisms in both trophic and non-trophic interactions. They also interact with abiotic components of ecosystems and with pollutants that humans produce (Dighton 2016). Indeed, interaction of fungi with humans has led to a whole new area of study of 'the built environment' as an ecosystem where fungi are under stress and have evolved to survive (Gostincar et al. 2011) and cause concern over human health and the integrity of their belongings.

Transcript abundance analysis involving eight known genes of various metabolic pathways and nine transcription factor genes showed temporal and tissue-dependent variation in expression under salinity. Reverse northern analysis of a few selected unknown and ribosomal genes exhibited much higher abundance of transcripts in response to salt stress. The results provide evidence that, in addition to several unknown genes discovered in this study, genes involved in ion transport, osmolyte production, and house-keeping functions may play an important role in the primary responses to salt stress in this grass halophyte.},

  abstract = {Plants interact with a variety of other community members that have the potential to indirectly influence each other through a shared host plant. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are generally considered plant mutualists because of their generally positive effects on plant nutrient status and growth. AMF may also have important indirect effects on plants by altering interactions with other community members. By influencing plant traits, AMF can modify aboveground interactions with both mutualists, such as pollinators, and antagonists, such as herbivores. Because herbivory and pollination can dramatically influence plant fitness, comprehensive assessment of plant–AMF interactions should include these indirect effects. To determine how AMF affect plant–insect interactions, we grew Cucumis sativus (Cucurbitaceae) under five AMF inoculum treatments and control. We measured plant growth, floral production, flower size, and foliar nutrient content of half the plants, and transferred the other half to a field setting to measure pollinator and herbivore preference of wild insects. Mycorrhizal treatment had no effect on plant biomass or floral traits but significantly affected leaf nutrients, pollinator behavior, and herbivore attack. Although total pollinator visitation did not vary with AMF treatment, pollinators exhibited taxon-specific responses, with honey bees, bumble bees, and Lepidoptera all responding differently to AMF treatments. Flower number and size were unaffected by treatments, suggesting that differences in pollinator preference were driven by other floral traits. Mycorrhizae influenced leaf K and Na, but these differences in leaf nutrients did not correspond to variation in herbivore attack. Overall, we found that AMF indirectly influence both antagonistic and mutualistic insects, but impacts depend on the identity of both the fungal partner and the interacting insect, underscoring the context-dependency of plant–AMF interactions.},

  abstract = {Although a few countries protect mangroves (USA, some states in Mexico), the systematic destruction of these ecosystems is increasing. Deforestation of mangrove communities is thought to be one of the major reasons for the decline in coastal fisheries of many tropical and subtropical countries. Although mangroves in the tropics can regenerate themselves or be restored using low-technology propagule planting, arid mangroves (areas having limited or no access to fresh water) can seldom regenerate, and if they do, it happens very slowly. To conserve arid tropical mangrove ecosystems, maintenance and restoration of the microbial communities is required. There is sufficient published evidence to propose a close microbe-nutrient-plant relationship that functions as a major mechanism for recycling and conserving essential nutrients in the mangrove ecosystem. The highly productive and diverse microbial community living in tropical and subtropical mangrove ecosystems continuously transforms dead vegetation into sources of nitrogen, phosphorus, and other nutrients that can later be used by the plants. In turn, plant-root exudates serve as a food source for the microorganisms living in the ecosystem, with other plant material serving a similar role for larger organisms, such as crabs and detritus-feeding fish. This speculative synthesis of recent work on growth-promoting bacteria proposes that mangrove rhizosphere bacteria be used as a tool to enhance reforestation with mangrove seedlings. This can be done by inoculating seedlings with plant-growth-promoting bacteria participating in one or more of the microbial cycles of the ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Coastal salt marshes are highly sensitive wetland ecosystems that can sustain long-term impacts from anthropogenic events such as oil spills. In this study, we examined the microbial communities of a Gulf of Mexico coastal salt marsh during and after the influx of petroleum hydrocarbons following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Total hydrocarbon concentrations in salt marsh sediments were highest in June and July 2010 and decreased in September 2010. Coupled PhyloChip and GeoChip microarray analyses demonstrated that the microbial community structure and function of the extant salt marsh hydrocarbon-degrading microbial populations changed significantly during the study. The relative richness and abundance of phyla containing previously described hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria) increased in hydrocarbon-contaminated sediments and then decreased once hydrocarbons were below detection. Firmicutes, however, continued to increase in relative richness and abundance after hydrocarbon concentrations were below detection. Functional genes involved in hydrocarbon degradation were enriched in hydrocarbon-contaminated sediments then declined significantly (p{$<$}0.05) once hydrocarbon concentrations decreased. A greater decrease in hydrocarbon concentrations among marsh grass sediments compared to inlet sediments (lacking marsh grass) suggests that the marsh rhizosphere microbial communities could also be contributing to hydrocarbon degradation. The results of this study provide a comprehensive view of microbial community structural and functional dynamics within perturbed salt marsh ecosystems.}

  abstract = {Metarhizium robertsii is a common soil fungus that occupies a specialized ecological niche as an endophyte and an insect pathogen. Previously, we showed that the endophytic capability and insect pathogenicity of Metarhizium are coupled to provide an active method of insect-derived nitrogen transfer to a host plant via fungal mycelia. We speculated that in exchange for this insect-derived nitrogen, the plant would provide photosynthate to the fungus. By using 13CO2, we show the incorporation of 13C into photosynthate and the subsequent translocation of 13C into fungal-specific carbohydrates (trehalose and chitin) in the root/endophyte complex. We determined the amount of 13C present in root-associated fungal biomass over a 21-day period by extracting fungal carbohydrates and analysing their composition using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These findings are evidence that the host plant is providing photosynthate to the fungus, likely in exchange for insect-derived nitrogen in a tripartite, and symbiotic, interaction.}

  abstract = {SUMMARY             The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses — the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {The importance of microbial root inhabitants for plant growth and health was recognized as early as 100 years ago. Recent insights reveal a close symbiotic relationship between plants and their associated microorganisms, and high structural and functional diversity within plant microbiomes. Plants provide microbial communities with specific habitats, which can be broadly categorized as the rhizosphere, phyllosphere, and endosphere. Plant-associated microbes interact with their host in essential functional contexts. They can stimulate germination and growth, help plants fend off disease, promote stress resistance, and influence plant fitness. Therefore, plants have to be considered as metaorganisms within which the associated microbes usually outnumber the cells belonging to the plant host. The structure of the plant microbiome is determined by biotic and abiotic factors but follows ecological rules. Metaorganisms are co-evolved species assemblages. The metabolism and morphology of plants and their microbiota are intensively connected with each other, and the interplay of both maintains the functioning and fitness of the holobiont. Our study of the current literature shows that analysis of plant microbiome data has brought about a paradigm shift in our understanding of the diverse structure and functioning of the plant microbiome with respect to the following: (i) the high interplay of bacteria, archaea, fungi, and protists; (ii) the high specificity even at cultivar level; (iii) the vertical transmission of core microbiomes; (iv) the extraordinary function of endophytes; and (v) several unexpected functions and metabolic interactions. The plant microbiome should be recognized as an additional factor in experimental botany and breeding strategies.},

We studied persistent effects of oil on ammonia-oxidizing archaeal (AOA) and bacterial (AOB) communities and their relationship to nitrification rates and soil properties in Louisiana marshes impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Soils were collected at oiled and unoiled sites from Louisiana coastal marshes in July 2012, two years after the spill, and analyzed for community differences based on ammonia monooxygenase genes (amoA). TRFLP and DNA sequence analyses revealed significantly different AOA and AOB communities between the three regions, but few differences were found between oiled and unoiled sites. Community composition of nitrifiers was best explained by differences in soil moisture and nitrogen content. Despite the lack of significant oil effects on overall community composition, we identified differences in correlations of individual populations with potential nitrification rates between oiled and unoiled sites that help explain previously published correlation patterns. Our results suggest that exposure to oil, even two years post-spill, led to subtle changes in population dynamics. How, or if, these changes may impact ecosystem function in the marshes, however, remains uncertain.},

The relationship between endophytes and their host plants has fascinated many among us especially for their ability to produce structurally unique phytocompounds of significant biopharmaceutical and biomedical importance. This review attempts at providing a comprehensive account on the mangrove fungal endophytic community by compiling research and review articles (from 1990 to 2019). It also covers past and recent publications related to antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxicity properties and emphasizing the potential of isolated metabolites from numerous mangrove fungal endophytes against a panel of human pathogenic microbes and cancer cell lines. It was found that mangrove endophytic fungi are capable to produce an impressive panoply of metabolites with promising biological activities including antioxidant, antimicrobial and anticancer. For instance, Sumalarins A–C isolated from Penicillium sumatrense of Lumnitzera racemosa Willd. and dimethylincisterol, ergosta-5,7,22-trien-3-ol, stigmast-4-en-3-one, stigmast-4-en-6,3-one, flufuran isolated from Pestalotiopsis sp. recovered from Rhizophora mucronata Lam. displayed potent cytotoxic activities against a panel of human cancer cell lines. However, there is still a dearth of knowledge that necessitates deeper investigation to further understand the relationship between mangrove endophytes and their host plants, especially those pertaining to phytochemicals. The endophytic fungi associated with mangroves are still at an infancy stage since only 27 mangrove species have been pharmacologically validated in terms of their endophytic fungi and thus this marked gap requires more in-depth investigations for a better understanding and clarification of their mechanisms of action.},

Fungal-colonized leaves and pure mycelia of fungi common on standing-dead leaves allowed intermediate growth. Growth on S. altern!flora-based diets was negatively correlated with the phenolics content of the food, and positively correlated with its lipid content. No correlation was found between growth and protein content. The digestibility of S. al-terniflora leaves, estimated with the acid-insoluble ash technique, was highest when yellow-green leaves were used. Colonization by fungi or bacteria caused it to de-cline.

The E high seedlings contained 5.5 times higher endophyte content and a greater diversity of fungal morphospecies than the E low treatment, and endophyte content was not correlated with leaf toughness or thickness. Leafcutting ants cut over 2.5 times the leaf area from E low relative to E high seedlings and had a tendency to recruit more ants to E low plants.

This study was designed to achieve a better understanding of the plant root-associated bacterial partnerships occurring within naturally revegetated hydrocarbon contaminated soils. Root endophytic bacterial communities were characterized from representative plant species throughout the site using both high-throughput sequencing and culturing techniques. Population abundance of rhizosphere and root endosphere bacteria was significantly influenced (p{$<$}0.05) by plant species and sampling location. In general, members of the Actinomycetales, Rhizobiales, Pseudomonadales, Burkholderiales, and Sphingomonadales orders were the most commonly identified orders. Community structure of root-associated bacteria was influenced by both plant species and sampling location. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the potential functional diversity of the root endophytic bacteria. The gene copy numbers of 16S rRNA and two hydrocarbon degrading genes (CYP153 and alkB) were significantly affected (p{$<$}0.05) by the interaction of plant species and sampling location.

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new way of using forward selection of explanatory variables in regression or canonical redundancy analysis. The classical forward selection method presents two problems: a highly inflated Type I error and an overestimation of the amount of explained variance. Correcting these problems will greatly improve the performance of this very useful method in ecological modeling. To prevent the first problem, we propose a two‐step procedure. First, a global test using all explanatory variables is carried out. If, and only if, the global test is significant, one can proceed with forward selection. To prevent overestimation of the explained variance, the forward selection has to be carried out with two stopping criteria: (1) the usual alpha significance level and (2) the adjusted coefficient of multiple determination (                                                              ) calculated using all explanatory variables. When forward selection identifies a variable that brings one or the other criterion over the fixed threshold, that variable is rejected, and the procedure is stopped. This improved method is validated by simulations involving univariate and multivariate response data. An ecological example is presented using data from the Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah, USA.},

  abstract = {an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) drilling platform and blowout of the Macondo well 1500 m below resulted in the worst marine oil spill on record. An estimated 205 million gallons of crude oil and 260,000–520,000 tons of methane (the energy equivalent of 80–155 million gallons of crude oil) were released into the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) over the following 87 days (Camilli et al., 2012; Joye et al., 2011; McNutt et al., 2011). The DWH blowout was unlike all other well-studied crude oil releases into marine environments. The blowout resulted in a massive shore-bound surface spill, but the discharge of oil and gas under high pressure at extreme depth also resulted in unprecedented deep-ocean persistence of highly dispersed hydrocarbons. Addressing both surface and subsurface conditions posed unanticipated challenges to governmental responses shaped by traditional surface spills (Peterson et al., 2012). Response efforts not only identified major gaps in baseline knowledge of vulnerable ecosystems (Peterson et al., 2012) but also demonstrated that advances in deepwater drilling far outpaced advances in spill containment and shoreline remediation. 3 60 REMEDIATION AND RESTORATION OF NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO Upon surfacing, oil from the blown Macondo well was transported across the northern GoM, where it grounded on shorelines from Louisiana to Florida. Within 9 days of the explosion on the DWH drilling rig, oil entered Louisiana wetlands at the mouth of the Mississippi River. Within a month, oil had coated shoreline beaches and wetlands throughout the Mississippi River Delta, the largest coastal wetland complex in the continental United States. By the time the disabled well had been capped, oil had grounded on shorelines throughout the northern GoM, including sensitive wildlife refuges like the Chandeleur Islands in Breton Sound, and white sand beaches fre-quented by tourists in Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi. As of January 20, 2011, surveys of more than 4000 linear miles of the northern GoM coast conducted for the preassessment phase of the Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) documented 1053 miles of oiled shoreline (http://www.gulfspillrestoration.noaa.gov/ oil-spill/gulf-spill-data/). The heaviest accumulations occurred in Louisiana as a consequence of currents and prevailing winds directing much of the oil to the west of the mouth of the Mississippi River. As in other states, oil grounded on to barrier island beaches, but much of the shore-bound oil penetrated into Mississippi River Delta wetland ecosystems. Oil entered marsh and mangrove habitats from the Bird's Foot Delta to Terrebonne Bay, including areas located miles inland from the ocean. Coastal ecosystems of the northern GoM encompass many of the most productive and biologically important habitats in North America. In addition to supporting sensitive resident species like the brown pelican, these areas shelter the majority of overwintering waterfowl that travel the Mississippi Flyway. Northern GoM coastal ecosystems also provide regulatory services such as storm protection, water filtration, and nutrient capture; provisioning services like finfish and shellfish fisheries; and cultural services including heritage tourism, recreation, and aesthetic value. Coastal habitats (e.g., oyster reefs and marshes) in Louisiana alone support 30\% of U.S. fisheries production, and it has been estimated that Mississippi River Delta ecosystems generate at least \$12–47 billion in annual benefits (Batker et al., 2010). As an economic asset, the Delta has a minimum value of \$330 billion to \$1.3 trillion, with 90\% of its value attributable to services derived from wetlands (Batker et al., 2010). Oil exposure has placed the ecological and economic well-being of the northern Gulf region at risk by potentially affecting many, if not all, of the valued services provided by these coastal ecosystems. The federal government, state governments, and the responsible party (British Petroleum (BP) Plc.) mounted a vast and complex response effort soon after oil from the Macondo well was detected in offshore waters. Responders were required to make difficult choices among possible interventions, including what steps to take to prevent oiling of shorelines and removal of oil from sensitive coastal ecosystems. Responders had to decide, for example, whether to contain and recover oil via skimming technologies versus chemically dispersing and burning hydrocarbons from the surface of the water. Experiences during prior oil spills have led to a general understanding that response actions can cause more harm than good. Pressurized hot-water washing of oiled rocky intertidal shorelines during the Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS), for example, likely induced greater macroalgal and invertebrate mortality than did exposure to oil (Peterson et al., 2003). Even though consideration is now given to the possibility of unintended outcomes, imperfect knowledge of},

To address hypotheses regarding the influence of plant host and soil biogeography on root fungal and bacterial communities, we designed a trap-plant bioassay experiment. Replicate Populus, Quercus and Pinus plants were grown in three soils originating from alternate field sites. Fungal and bacterial community profiles in the root of each replicate were assessed through multiplex 454 amplicon sequencing of four loci (i.e., 16S, SSU, ITS, LSU rDNA). Soil origin had a larger effect on fungal community composition than did host species, but the opposite was true for bacterial communities. Populus hosted the highest diversity of rhizospheric fungi and bacteria. Root communities on Quercus and Pinus were more similar to each other than to Populus. Overall, fungal root symbionts appear to be more constrained by dispersal and biogeography than by host availability.},

The term 'community' is applied ambiguously; in some cases, the term refers simply to a set of observed entities, while in other cases, it requires that these entities interact with one another. Microorganisms can rapidly gain and lose genes, potentially decoupling community roles from taxonomic and phylogenetic groupings. Trait-based approaches offer a useful alternative, but many traits can be defined based on gene functions, metabolic modules, and genomic properties, and the optimal set of traits to choose is often not obvious. An analysis that considers taxon assignment and traits in concert may be ideal, with the strengths of each approach offsetting the weaknesses of the other. Individual genes also merit consideration as entities in an ecological analysis, with characteristics such as diversity, turnover, and interactions modeled using genes rather than organisms as entities. We identify some promising avenues of research that are likely to yield a deeper understanding of microbial communities that shift from observation-based questions of 'Who is there?' and 'What are they doing?' to the mechanistically driven question of 'How will they respond?'},

  abstract = {Global climate models predict a future of increased severity of drought in many tropical forests. Soil microbes are central to the balance of these systems as sources or sinks of atmospheric carbon (C), yet how they respond metabolically to drought is not well-understood. We simulated drought in the typically aseasonal Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico, by intercepting precipitation falling through the forest canopy. This approach reduced soil moisture by 13\% and water potential by 0.14 MPa (from -0.2 to -0.34). Previous results from this experiment have demonstrated that the diversity and composition of these soil microbial communities are sensitive to even small changes in soil water. Here, we show prolonged drought significantly alters the functional potential of the community and provokes a clear osmotic stress response, including the production of compatible solutes that increase intracellular C demand. Subsequently, a microbial population emerges with a greater capacity for extracellular enzyme production targeting macromolecular carbon. Significantly, some of these drought-induced functional shifts in the soil microbiota are attenuated by prior exposure to a short-term drought suggesting that acclimation may occur despite a lack of longer-term drought history.},

  abstract = {Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a widely used technique in microbial community analysis, allowing the quantification of the number of target genes in a community sample. Currently, the standard-curve (SC) method of absolute quantification is widely employed for these kinds of analysis. However, the SC method assumes that the amplification efficiency ( E ) is the same for both the standard and the sample target template. We analyzed 19 bacterial strains and nine environmental samples in qPCR assays, targeting the nifH and 16S rRNA genes. The E values of the qPCRs differed significantly, depending on the template. This has major implications for the quantification. If the sample and standard differ in their E values, quantification errors of up to orders of magnitude are possible. To address this problem, we propose and test the one-point calibration (OPC) method for absolute quantification. The OPC method corrects for differences in E and was derived from the ΔΔ  C T  method with correction for E , which is commonly used for relative quantification in gene expression studies. The SC and OPC methods were compared by quantifying artificial template mixtures from Geobacter sulfurreducens (DSM 12127) and Nostoc commune (Culture Collection of Algae and Protozoa [CCAP] 1453/33), which differ in their E values. While the SC method deviated from the expected nifH gene copy number by 3- to 5-fold, the OPC method quantified the template mixtures with high accuracy. Moreover, analyzing environmental samples, we show that even small differences in E between the standard and the sample can cause significant differences between the copy numbers calculated by the SC and the OPC methods.}

  abstract = {Light limitation is a major driver of succession and an important determinant of the performance of shade-intolerant tree seedlings. Shade intolerance may result from a resource allocation strategy characterized by rapid growth and high metabolic costs, which may make shade-intolerant species particularly sensitive to nutrient limitation and pathogen pressure. In this study, we evaluated the degree to which nitrogen availability and fungal pathogen pressure interact to influence plant performance across different light environments. To test this, we manipulated nitrogen availability (high, low) and access by foliar fungal pathogens (sprayed with fungicide, unsprayed) to seedlings of the shade-intolerant tree,               Liquidambar styraciflua               , growing at low and high light availability, from forest understory to adjacent old field. Foliar fungal damage varied with light and nitrogen availability; in low light, increasing nitrogen availability tripled foliar damage, suggesting that increased nutrient availability in low light makes plants more susceptible to disease. Despite higher foliar damage under low light, spraying fungicide to exclude pathogens promoted 14\% greater plant height only under high light conditions. Thus, although nitrogen availability and pathogen pressure each influenced aspects of plant performance, these effects were context dependent and overwhelmed by light limitation. This suggests that failure of shade-intolerant species to invade closed-canopy forest can be explained by light limitation alone.},

ITS sequences were amplified with ascomycete-specific primers from DNA extracted from S. alterniflora blades at two stages of decay (early and late) and were identified based on sequence analysis of a companion ascomycete culture collection. The S. alterniflora ITS libraries were dominated by clones from three species of ascomycetes: Mycosphaerella sp. 2, Phaeosphaeria spartinicola, and Phaeosphaeria halima. ITS sequences from five other less abundant ascomycete species were also found in the clone libraries, only two of which could be identified based on the culture collection, Hydropisphaera erubescens and a new species nicknamed '4clt'. Ascospore expulsion assays indicated dominance by the same three species as the ITS analysis, although this non-molecular approach differed from the molecular method in relative ranking of the dominant species and in characterization of minor species. Analysis of ITS amplicons from three replicate plots by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis showed significant spatial homogeneity in ascomycete community composition for both early- and late-stage decay. ITS sequence analysis identified morphologically cryptic subgroups for two of the three dominant salt marsh ascomycetes.}

  abstract = {Both bacteria and fungi play critical roles in decomposition processes in many natural environments, yet only rarely have they been studied as an integrated microbial community. Here we describe the bacterial and fungal assemblages associated with two decomposition stages of Spartina alterniflora detritus in a productive southeastern U.S. salt marsh. 16S rRNA genes and 18S-to-28S internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions were used to target the bacterial and ascomycete fungal communities, respectively, based on DNA sequence analysis of isolates and environmental clones and by using community fingerprinting based on terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis. Seven major bacterial taxa (six affiliated with the ␣-Pro-teobacteria and one with the Cytophagales) and four major fungal taxa were identified over five sample dates spanning 13 months. Fungal terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) were informative at the species level; however, bacterial T-RFs frequently comprised a number of related genera. Amplicon abundances indicated that the salt marsh saprophyte communities have little-to-moderate variability spatially or with decomposition stage, but considerable variability temporally. However, the temporal variability could not be readily explained by either successional shifts or simple relationships with environmental factors. Significant correlations in abundance (both positive and negative) were found among dominant fungal and bacterial taxa that possibly indicate ecological interactions between decomposer organisms. Most associations involved one of four mi-crobial taxa: two groups of bacteria affiliated with the ␣-Proteobacteria and two ascomycete fungi (Phaeosphaeria spartinicola and environmental isolate " 4clt "). Southeastern U.S. coastal salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems known (24, 31) and provide a model environment for investigating detritus-based ecosystems and their decomposer communities. In these systems, both fungi and bacteria are recognized as key components of the decom-poser community (1, 26), providing primary links in the remin-eralization and transformation of decaying vascular plant ma-terial. In the few studies that have considered the activity of salt marsh bacterial and fungal saprophytes simultaneously, inter-actions between fungi and bacteria have been hypothesized to be based on temporal resource partitioning (29). According to this view, fungal colonization of senescing salt marsh cord grass (Spartina alterniflora) mediates the initial transformation of organic matter through extracellular enzyme activity and phys-ical disruption (24, 26). In the fungus-dominated stage, Spar-tina undergoes loss of up to 60\% of the original organic mass (26). As decomposition proceeds, the blades gradually collapse onto the marsh sediment and are reduced to smaller pieces with larger surface areas. Bacterial standing crop gradually increases, and bacteria assume a more prominent position in the latter stages of the decomposition process (1, 29). This view of temporally segregated fungal and bacterial de-composition in salt marshes may be overly simplistic, however.}

Microbial populations were sampled four times corresponding to major plant phenological stages (dormancy, vegetative growth, reproduction, and senescence) previously linked to changes in microbial populations under field conditions. Benomyl-treatment of soil cores significantly suppressed AM colonization on S. patens, keeping values relatively consistent throughout the growing season (11.5\%) whereas plants in non-treated cores experienced seasonal increases and declines in AM colonization (26.6\% during vegetative growth to 11.5\% during dormancy). Soil physicochemical parameters were not affected by benomyl application. In unvegetated cores, no benomyl- or seasonal effects were displayed by cell numbers and specific biomass of DAPI-stained organisms, members of the domain bacteria and here especially members of the ??-, ??-, ??- and ??-subdivisions of proteobacteria that were the most abundant bacterial groups. In vegetated cores, the microbial community as well as specific bacterial populations were at least twice as large in terms of number and biomass than in samples from unvegetated cores with significant seasonal changes for DAPI-stained cells, for members of the domain bacteria and for members of the ??- and ??-subdivisions of proteobacteria. In benomyl-treated cores, the population of ??-subdivision of proteobacteria was significantly smaller than in non-treated cores, and a positive association was found between this bacterial group and root length colonized by AM suggesting that AM-suppression can affect populations of specific soil bacterial populations in salt marsh sediment. Benomyl-treatment had no effect on the diversity of N-fixing bacteria as evidenced by PCR-RFLP analysis, but seasonal changes were noted in vegetated cores with populations during active plant growth substantially different from populations during dormancy and senescence. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Leaf endophytes and host plant genotypes may interact to determine plant disease severity. In a greenhouse inoculation experiment, we found that leaf endophyte species and Populus angustifolia genotypes both affected disease outcomes in plants inoculated with the necrotrophic leaf pathogen Drepanopeziza populi. Contrary to many studies showing endophytes conferring defense, all plant genotypes inoculated with the endophyte Penicillium sp. prior to inoculation with the pathogen D. populi were characterized by greater pathogen symptom severity than plants inoculated with the pathogen only. We quantified defense gene expression via qRT-PCR, but found no evidence that increased pathogen damage was related to differential expression of the assayed genes. A second endophyte, Truncatella angustata, which was previously found to reduce symptom severity of the biotrophic pathogen Melampsora in Populus trichocarpa, did not affect symptom severity of the necrotrophic pathogen D. populi or defense gene expression. Overall, our study highlights the variable effects of endophytes on pathogen symptom severity, and illustrates that plant genotypic variation can remain important for disease outcomes even in the presence of endophytes altering disease. Additional work is needed to elucidate the mechanism by which fungal leaf endophytes alter disease in their host plants. © 2013 Busby et al.},

However, experiments have not been combined with ecological studies in wild plant pathosystems to determine whether disease-modifying fungi are com- mon enough to be ecologically important. We used culture-based methods and DNA sequencing to characterize the abundance and distribution of foliar fungi of Populus trichocarpa in wild populations across its native range (Pacific Northwest, USA). We conducted complementary, manipulative experiments to test how foliar fungi commonly isolated from those populations influence the severity of Melampsora leaf rust disease. Finally, we examined correlative relationships between the abundance of disease-modifying foliar fungi and disease severity in wild trees. A taxonomically and geographically diverse group of common foliar fungi significantly modified disease severity in experiments, either increasing or decreasing disease severity. Spa- tial patterns in the abundance of some of these foliar fungi were significantly correlated (in predicted directions) with disease severity in wild trees. Our study reveals that disease modification is an ecological function shared by common foliar fungal symbionts of P. trichocarpa. This finding raises new questions about plant disease ecology and plant biodiversity, and has applied potential for disease management.},

The rapid pace of advancement in endophyte ecology warrants a pause to synthesize our understanding of endophyte disease modification and to discuss future research directions. We reviewed recent literature on fungal endophyte disease modification, and here report on several emergent themes: (1) Fungal endophyte effects on plant disease span the full spectrum from pathogen antagonism to pathogen facilitation, with pathogen antagonism most commonly reported. (2) Agricultural plant pathosystems are the focus of research on endophyte disease modification. (3) A taxonomically diverse group of fungal endophytes can influence plant disease severity. And (4) Fungal endophyte effects on plant disease severity are context-dependent. Our review highlights the importance of fungal endophytes for plant disease across a broad range of plant pathosystems, yet simultaneously reveals that complexity within plant microbiomes presents a significant challenge to disentangling the biotic environmental factors affecting plant disease severity. Manipulative studies integrating eco-evolutionary approaches with emerging molecular tools will be poised to elucidate the functional importance of endophytes in natural plant pathosystems that are fundamental to biodiversity and conservation.},

  abstract = {Species enter and persist in local communities because of their ecological fit to local conditions, and recently, ecologists have moved from measuring diversity as species richness and evenness, to using measures that reflect species ecological differences. There are two principal approaches for quantifying species ecological differences: functional (trait-based) and phylogenetic pairwise distances between species. Both approaches have produced new ecological insights, yet at the same time methodological issues and assumptions limit them. Traits and phylogeny may provide different, and perhaps complementary, information about species' differences. To adequately test assembly hypotheses, a framework integrating the information provided by traits and phylogenies is required. We propose an intuitive measure for combining functional and phylogenetic pairwise distances, which provides a useful way to assess how functional and phylogenetic distances contribute to understanding patterns of community assembly. Here, we show that both traits and phylogeny inform community assembly patterns in alpine plant communities across an elevation gradient, because they represent complementary information. Differences in historical selection pressures have produced variation in the strength of the trait-phylogeny correlation, and as such, integrating traits and phylogeny can enhance the ability to detect assembly patterns across habitats or environmental gradients.},

However, neutral evolutionary processes such as random colonization, spatially restricted gene flow, and genetic drift could also result in similar spatial patterns, especially for single-locus traits because of their susceptibility to stochastic events. One way to distinguish between adaptive and neutral mechanisms is to compare the focal trait to neutral genetic loci to determine whether neutral loci demonstrate clinal variation (consistent with a neutral cline), or not. Ivyleaf morning glory, Ipomoea hederacea, exhibits a latitudinal cline for a Mendelian leaf shape polymorphism in eastern North America, such that lobed genotypes dominate northern populations and heart-shaped genotypes are restricted to southern populations. Here, we evaluate potential evolutionary mechanisms for this cline by first determining the allele frequencies at the leaf shape locus for 77 populations distributed throughout I.~hederacea's range and then comparing the geographical pattern at this locus to neutral amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) loci. We detected both significant clinal variation and high genetic differentiation at the leaf shape locus across all populations. In contrast, 99\% of the putatively neutral loci do not display clinal variation, and I.~hederacea populations show very little overall genetic differentiation, suggesting that there is a moderate level of gene flow. In addition, the leaf shape locus was identified as a major F(ST) outlier experiencing divergent selection, relative to all the AFLP loci. Together, these data strongly suggest that the cline in leaf shape is being maintained by spatially varying natural selection.},

Results: In its initial form, T-BAS v1.0 uses a core phylogeny of 979 taxa (including 23 outgroup taxa, as well as 61 orders, 175 families and 496 genera) representing all 13 classes of largest subphylum of Fungi - Pezizomycotina (Ascomycota) - based on sequence alignments for six loci (nr5.8S, nrLSU, nrSSU, mtSSU, RPB1, RPB2). T-BAS v1.0 has three main uses: (i) Users may download alignments and voucher tables for members of the Pezizomycotina directly from the reference tree, facilitating systematics studies of focal clades. (ii) Users may upload sequence files with reads representing unknown taxa and place these on the phylogeny using either BLAST or phylogeny-based approaches, and then use the displayed tree to select reference taxa to include when downloading alignments. The placement of unknowns can be performed for large numbers of Sanger sequences obtained from fungal cultures and for alignable, short reads of environmental amplicons. (iii) User-customizable metadata can be visualized on the tree.}

  abstract = {The mangrove ecosystem is a coastal tropical biome located in the transition zone between land and sea that is characterized by periodic flooding, which confers unique and specific environmental conditions on this biome. In these ecosystems, the vegetation is dominated by a particular group of plant species that provide a unique environment harboring diverse groups of microorganisms, including the endophytic microorganisms that are the focus of this study. Because of their intimate association with plants, endophytic microorganisms could be explored for biotechnologically significant products, such as enzymes, proteins, antibiotics and others. Here, we isolated endophytic microorganisms from two mangrove species, Rhizophora mangle and Avicennia nitida, that are found in streams in two mangrove systems in Bertioga and Cananéia, Brazil. Bacillus was the most frequently isolated genus, comprising 42\% of the species isolated from Cananéia and 28\% of the species from Bertioga. However, other common endophytic genera such as Pantoea, Curtobacterium and Enterobacter were also found. After identifying the isolates, the bacterial communities were evaluated for enzyme production. Protease activity was observed in 75\% of the isolates, while endoglucanase activity occurred in 62\% of the isolates. Bacillus showed the highest activity rates for amylase and esterase and endoglucanase. To our knowledge, this is the first reported diversity analysis performed on endophytic bacteria obtained from the branches of mangrove trees and the first overview of the specific enzymes produced by different bacterial genera. This work contributes to our knowledge of the microorganisms and enzymes present in mangrove ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Mangroves are ecosystems located in the transition zone between land and sea that serve as a potential source of biotechnological resources. Brazil's extensive coast contains one of the largest mangrove forests in the world (encompassing an area of 25,000 km(2) along all the coast). Endophytic bacteria were isolated from the following three plant species: Rhizophora mangle, Laguncularia racemosa and Auicennia nitida. A large number of these isolates, 115 in total, were evaluated for their ability to fix nitrogen and solubilize phosphorous. Bacteria that tested positive for both of these tests were examined further to determine their level of indole acetic acid production. Two strains with high indole acetic acid production were selected for use as inoculants for reforestation trees, and then the growth of the plants was evaluated under field conditions. The bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens (strain MCR1.10) had a low phosphorus solubilization index, while this index was higher in the other strain used, Enterobacter sp. (strain MCR1.48). We used the reforestation tree Acacia polyphylla. The results indicate that inoculation with the MCR1.48 endophyte increases Acacia polyphylla shoot dry mass, demonstrating that this strain effectively promotes the plant's growth and fitness, which can be used in the seedling production of this tree. Therefore, we successfully screened the biotechnological potential of endophyte isolates from mangrove, with a focus on plant growth promotion, and selected a strain able to provide limited nutrients and hormones for in plant growth.

These deposits were depleted of symbiotic fungi when first exposed but colonized by them over time after exposure. Four major groups of plant species in this system are (1) mycorrhiza-independent or facultative mycotrophic, (2) dependent on arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) (3) dependent on ericoid mycorrhiza (ERM) or ectomycorrhizae (EM), and (4) colonized by dark-septate (DS) endophytes. We hypothesized that availability of mycorrhizal propagules was related to the success of mycorrhiza-dependent plants in colonizing new substrates in naturally evolved ecosystems. To test this hypothesis roots samples of 66 plant species were examined for mycorrhizal colonization. The plants were sampled from communities at increasing distances from the glacier terminus to compare the newest communities with successively older ones. Long established, secondary successional dry meadow communities adjacent to the glacier forefront, and nearby high alpine communities were sampled for comparison. DS were common on most plant species on the forefront. Nonmycorrhizal plants predominated in the earlier successional sites, whereas the proportion of mycorrhizal plants generally increased with age of community. AM were present, mostly at low levels, and nearly absent in two sites of the forefront. ERM were present in all species of Ericaceae sampled, and EM in all species of Pinaceae and Salicaceae. Roots of plants in the long established meadow and heath communities adjacent to the forefront and the high alpine community all had one or another of the colonization types, with DS and AM predominating. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

Using a common life history classification framework for both plants and AM fungi could also help in predicting probable species associations in natural communities and increase our fundamental understanding of the interaction between land plants and AM fungi. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Understanding the factors that shape com- munity assembly remains one of the most enduring and important questions in modern ecology. Network theory can reveal rules of community assembly within and across study systems and suggest novel hypotheses regarding the formation and stability of communities. However, such studies generally face the challenge of disentangling the relative influence of factors such as interaction type and environmental conditions on shaping communities and associated networks. Endophytic and endolichenic symbi- oses, characterized by microbial species that occur within healthy plants and lichen thalli, represent some of the most ubiquitous interactions in nature. Fungi that engage in these symbioses are hyperdiverse, often horizontally transmitted, and functionally beneficial in many cases, and they repre- sent the diversification of multiple phylogenetic groups. We evaluated six measures of ecological network structure for {$>$}4100 isolates of endophytic and endolichenic fungi collected systematically from five sites across North Amer- ica. Our comparison of these co-occurring interactions in biomes ranging from tundra to subtropical forest showed that the type of interactions (i.e., endophytic vs. endoli- chenic) had a much more pronounced influence on network structure than did environmental conditions. In particular, endophytic networks were less nested, less connected, and more modular than endolichenic networks in all sites. The consistency of the network structure within each interaction type, independent of site, is encouraging for current efforts devoted to gathering metadata on ecological network struc- ture at a global scale. We discuss several mechanisms potentially responsible for such patterns and draw attention to knowledge gaps in our understanding of networks for diverse interaction types.},

Estimates suggest that roughly 3–13 million fungal species exist worldwide, yet considerable knowledge gaps exist regarding the mechanisms and consequences, both ecological and social, of fungal dispersal from local to global scales. In this review, we summarize concepts underlying fungal dispersal, review recent research, and explore how fungi possess unique characteristics that can broaden our understanding of general dispersal ecology. We highlight emerging frontiers in fungal dispersal research that integrate technological advances with trait-based ecology, movement ecology, social–ecological systems, and work in unexplored environments. Outstanding research questions across these themes are presented to stimulate theoretical and empirical research in fungal dispersal ecology. Advances in fungal dispersal will improve our understanding of fungal community assembly and biogeography across a range of spatial scales, with implications for ecosystem functioning, global food security, and human health.},

Putative homologs of genes required for the CSP were analyzed for their putative role in endophytic colonization. Proteomic and suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) approaches were also applied, and a comparison of defense-related processes was carried out by setting up a pathosystem for flooded roots with Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae strain PXO99 (Xoo). All tested genes were expressed in rice roots seedlings but not induced upon Azoarcus sp. inoculation, and the oscyclops and oscastor mutants were not impaired in endophytic colonization. Global approaches highlighted changes in rice metabolic activity and Ca(2+) -dependent signaling in roots colonized by endophytes, including some stress proteins. Marker genes for defense responses were induced to a lesser extent by the endophytes than by the pathogen, indicating a more compatible interaction. Our results thus suggest that rice roots respond to endophytic colonization by inducing metabolic shifts and signaling events, for which the CSP is not essential.},

We determined the range sizes of 74,134 bacterial and archaeal taxa found in settled dust collected from 1,065 locations across the United States. We found that most microorganisms have small ranges and few have large ranges, a pattern similar to the range size distributions commonly observed for macrobes. However, contrary to expectations, those microbial taxa which were locally abundant did not necessarily have larger range sizes. The observed differences in microbial range sizes were generally predictable from taxonomic identity, phenotypic traits, genomic attributes, and habitat preferences, findings that provide insight into the factors shaping patterns of microbial biogeography.},

  abstract = {The field of microbiome research is arguably one of the fastest growing in biology. Bacteria feature prominently in studies on animal health, but fungi appear to be the more prominent functional symbionts for plants. Despite the similarities in the ecological organization and evolutionary importance of animal-bacterial and plant–fungal microbiomes, there is a general failure across disciplines to integrate the advances made in each system. Researchers studying bacterial symbionts in animals benefit from greater access to efficient sequencing pipelines and taxonomic reference databases, perhaps due to high medical and veterinary interest. However, researchers studying plant–fungal symbionts benefit from the relative tractability of fungi under laboratory conditions and ease of cultivation. Thus each system has strengths to offer, but both suffer from the lack of a common conceptual framework. We argue that community ecology best illuminates complex species interactions across space and time. In this synthesis we compare and contrast the animal-bacterial and plant–fungal microbiomes using six core theories in community ecology (i.e., succession, community assembly, metacommunities, multitrophic interactions, disturbance, restoration). The examples and questions raised are meant to spark discussion amongst biologists and lead to the integration of these two systems, as well as more informative, manipulatory experiments on microbiomes research.},

Although a large amount of evidence suggests a mutualistic role for vertically transmitted endophytic fungi in agronomic grasses, the role of horizontally transmitted endophytic fungi as mutualists has been challenged. Recent studies, however, have shown that horizontally transmitted endophytic fungi can act as mutualists to their plant hosts by providing defense against pathogens and defoliators. In particular, several experimental studies have shown that endophytic fungi interact negatively with leaf-cutting ants and their fungal cultivar, but these studies were performed under laboratory conditions. Using field colonies of Atta colombica in Central Panama, we measured the fungal endophyte content in the forage material of leaf-cutting ants and compared it to ambient endophyte levels. We then used the collected data to model the area of plant material containing endophytes that enters a mature colony daily. We found that mature colonies collect leaf material that is 20\% lower in endophyte abundance than surrounding leaves. A similar pattern was observed for newly emerged colonies. Our model suggests that via ant foraging preferences, leaf-cutting ants reduce the possible area of material containing endophytes entering the colony by 33\%. Our results provide further evidence for a negative interaction between leaf-cutting ants and horizontally transmitted endophytes, suggesting that fungal endophytes have a defensive role in tropical plants by influencing leafcutting ant foraging preferences.

Phylogenetic profiling revealed that the composition of prokaryotic communities was primarily determined by the plant compartment, whereas the composition of fungal commu-nities was mainly influenced by the biogeography of the host species. Cultivated A. tequilana exhibited lower levels of prokaryotic diversity compared with native agaves, although no differences in microbial diversity were found in the endosphere.

Plant-associated microorganisms, and in particular endophytes, have lately received high attention, because of the increasing awareness of the importance of host-associated microbiota for the functioning and performance of their host. Some endophyte functions are known from mostly lab assays, genome prediction and few metagenome analyses, however, we have limited understanding on in planta activities, particularly considering the diversity of micro-environments and the dynamics of conditions.

We collected and reared caterpillars from the understorey and trail edges of a wet forest and a seasonally dry forest to determine whether wet-forest caterpillars suffered a higher prevalence of parasitism and were less abundant than dry-forest caterpillars. In the two forests, caterpillar abundances (on average 8 h-1) and prevalence of parasitism (18\%) were very similar regardless of feeding niche for both parasitism (27\% versus 29\% in shelter builders, and 16\% versus 11\% in external feeders) and caterpillar abundances (shelter builders: 1.42 versus 2.39, and external feeders: 8.27 versus 5.49 caterpillars h-1) in the dry and wet forests, respectively. A similar comparative analysis conducted in the canopy and understorey of the dry forest revealed a higher prevalence of parasitism in the canopy (43\%) despite caterpillar densities similar to those in the understorey. Overall, shelter builders suffered higher parasitism than external feeders (32\% versus 14.9\%), and were attacked primarily by flies, whereas external feeders were more vulnerable to attack by parasitoid wasps. ? 2010 Cambridge University Press.},

  abstract = {Many tidally influenced freshwater forested wetlands (tidal swamps) along the south Atlantic coast of the USA are currently undergoing dieback and decline. Salinity often drives conversion of tidal swamps to marsh, especially under conditions of regional drought. During this change, alterations in nitrogen (N) uptake from dominant vegetation or timing of N recycling from the canopy during annual litter senescence may help to facilitate marsh encroachment by providing for greater bioavailable N with small increases in salinity. To monitor these changes along with shifts in stand productivity, we established sites along two tidal swamp landscape transects on the lower reaches of the Waccamaw River (South Carolina) and Savannah River (Georgia) representing freshwater (a parts per thousand currency sign0.1 psu), low oligohaline (1.1-1.6 psu), and high oligohaline (2.6-4.1 psu) stands; the latter stands have active marsh encroachment. Aboveground tree productivity was monitored on all sites through monthly litterfall collection and dendrometer band measurements from 2005 to 2009. Litterfall samples were pooled by season and analyzed for total N and carbon (C). On average between the two rivers, freshwater, low oligohaline, and high oligohaline tidal swamps returned 8,126, 3,831, and 1,471 mg N m(-2) year(-1), respectively, to the forest floor through litterfall, with differences related to total litterfall volume rather than foliar N concentrations. High oligohaline sites were most inconsistent in patterns of foliar N concentrations and N loading from the canopy. Leaf N content generally decreased and foliar C/N generally increased with salinization (excepting one site), with all sites being fairly inefficient in resorbing N from leaves prior to senescence. Stands with higher salinity also had greater flood frequency and duration, lower basal area increments, lower tree densities, higher numbers of dead or dying trees, and much reduced leaf litter fall (103 vs. 624 g m(-2) year(-1)) over the five study years. Our data suggest that alternative processes, such as the rate of decomposition and potential for N mineralization, on tidal swamp sites undergoing salinity-induced state change may be more important for controlling N biogeochemical cycling in soils than differences among sites in N loading via litterfall.},

  abstract = {1. Remnants from oil spills can persist for decades within anoxic coastal sediments affecting local flora and fauna, but few studies have examined the long-term impacts of the residual petroleum on these valuable coastal ecosystems. The Wild Harbor salt marsh (Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, USA) still harbours residual petroleum from a 1969 oil spill, which released 700 000 L of No. 2 fuel oil. Previous effects have been noted in fiddler crabs and ribbed mussels inhabiting the oiled marsh. 3. Spartina alterniflora biomass was sampled above- and below-ground in elevational transects through areas with different total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) content. Further, elevational differences were mapped in oiled and non-oiled locations. 4. Stem density and above- and below-ground biomass decreased in oiled areas. The decreased vegetation biomass led to unconsolidated sediments, increased topographical variation and, ultimately, loss of salt marsh habitat. 5. Four decades after the Florida spill, with only 100 kg of the original 595 000 kg of spilt oil persisting in salt marsh sediment, the effects on large-scale ecosystem functions are still evident. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate specific impacts of residual petroleum on S. alterniflora biomass and coastal erosion. Further, we have defined TPH content thresholds at which to expect long-term ecosystem impacts. The recalcitrant nature of these contaminants and their chronic large-scale ecosystem effects leads to the potential demand for alternative compensation, such as preservation of coastal systems at risk elsewhere. © 2008 The Authors.},

Mutualistic endophytic microbes with an emphasis on the relatively understudied fungal endophytes are the focus of this special book. Plants are associated with micro-organisms: endophytic bacteria and fungi, which live inter- and intra-cellularly without inducing pathogenic symptoms, but have active biochemical and genetic interactions with their host. Endophytes play vital roles as plant growth promoters, biocontrol agents, biosurfactant producers, enzymes and secondary metabolite producers, as well as providing a new hidden repertoire of bioactive natural products with uses in pharmaceutical, agrochemical and other biotechnological applications. The increasing interest in endophytic research generates significant progress in our understanding of the host-endophyte relationship at molecular and genetic level. The bio-prospection of microbial endophytes has led to exciting possibilities for their biotechnological application as biocontrol agent, bioactive metabolites, and other useful traits. Apart from these virtues, the microbial endophytes may be adapted to the complex metabolism of many desired molecules that can be of significant industrial applications. These microbes can be a useful alternative for sustainable solutions for ecological control of pests and diseases, and can reduce the burden of excess of chemical fertilizers for this purpose. This book is an attempt to review the recent development in the understanding of microbial endophytes and their potential biotechnological applications. This is a collection of literature authored by noted researchers having signatory status in endophytic research and summarizes the development achieved so far, and future prospects for further research in this fascinating area of research.},

We suggest that through associations with other traits, seeds are likely to exhibit defense syndromes that reflect constraints or trade-offs imposed by selection to attract dispersers, enable effective dispersal, ensure appropriate timing of seed germination, and enhance seedling performance. We draw attention to seed and reproductive traits that are analogous to defense traits in mature plants and describe how the effectiveness of defenses is likely to differ at pre- and postdispersal stages. We also highlight recent insights into the mutualistic and antagonistic interactions between seeds and microbial communities, including fungi and endohyphal bacteria, that can influence seed survival in the soil and subsequent seedling vigor.},

  abstract = {Herbarium specimens represent important records of morphological and genetic diversity of plants that inform questions relevant to global change, including species distributions, phenology and functional traits. It is increasingly appreciated that plant microbiomes can influence these aspects of plant biology, but little is known regarding the historic distribution of microbes associated with plants collected in the pre-molecular age. If microbiomes can be observed reliably in herbarium specimens, researchers will gain a new lens with which to examine microbial ecology, evolution, species interactions. Here, we describe a method for accessing historical plant microbiomes from preserved herbarium specimens, providing a proof of concept using two plant taxa from the imperiled boreal biome (               Andromeda polifolia               and               Ledum palustre               subsp               . groenlandicum,               Ericaceae). We focus on fungal endophytes, which occur within symptomless plant tissues such as leaves. Through a three-part approach (i.e. culturing, cloning and next-generation amplicon sequencing via the Illumina MiSeq platform, with extensive controls), we examined endophyte communities in dried, pressed leaves that had been processed as regular herbarium specimens and stored at room temperature in a herbarium for four years               .               We retrieved only one endophyte in culture, but cloning and especially the MiSeq analysis revealed a rich community of foliar endophytes. The phylogenetic distribution and diversity of endophyte assemblages, especially among the Ascomycota, resemble endophyte communities from fresh plants collected in the boreal biome. We could distinguish communities of endophytes in each plant species and differentiate likely endophytes from fungi that could be surface contaminants. Taxa found by cloning were observed in the larger MiSeq dataset, but species richness was greater when subsets of the same tissues were evaluated with the MiSeq approach. Our findings provide a proof of concept for capturing endophyte DNA from herbarium specimens, supporting the importance of herbarium records as roadmaps for understanding the dynamics of plant-associated microbial biodiversity in the Anthropocene.

The genetic basis underlying these adaptations is, however, virtually unknown. Based on advances in pyrosequencing, we present here the first transcriptome analysis for plants for which no prior genomic information was available. We selected the mangroves Rhizophora mangle (Rhizophoraceae) and Heritiera littoralis (Malvaceae) as ecologically important extremophiles employing markedly different physiological and life-history strategies for survival and dominance in this extreme environment. For maximal representation of conditional transcripts, mRNA was obtained from a variety of developmental stages, tissues types, and habitats. For each species, a normalized cDNA library of pooled mRNAs was analysed using GSFLX pyrosequencing. A total of 537,635 sequences were assembled de novo and annotated as {$>$} 13,000 distinct gene models for each species. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthology annotations highlighted remarkable similarities in the mangrove transcriptome profiles, which differed substantially from the model plants Arabidopsis and Populus. Similarities in the two species suggest a unique mangrove lifestyle overarching the effects of transcriptome size, habitat, tissue type, developmental stage, and biogeographic and phylogenetic differences between them.},

The LaBranche (LB) wetlands bordering Lake Pontchartrain are severely degraded due to saltwater intrusion, subsidence, leveeing of the river, and hydrologic alterations including partial impoundment. Directly adjacent is the Bonnet Carr?? (BC) spillway, a geomorphically similar area that contains healthy baldcypress swamp. The spillway carries river water to the lake during high discharge years and has been opened eleven times in 80 years, with flows as high as 9000m 3s -1. The primary hydrologic difference between the two areas is the regular input of River water to the BC wetlands while the LB wetlands are isolated from the river. The interior of the LB wetlands is also isolated from sediment originating from Lake Pontchartrain. Long-term accretion, tree growth, and elevation were measured in these two wetland areas to determine impacts of riverine input. 137Cs accretion rates in the BC wetlands were 2.6-2.7cmyr -1, compared to 0.43 and 1.4cmyr -1, respectively, in the LB wetlands in areas without and with sediment input from Lake Pontchartrain. Baldypress growth in the BC averaged about 2.3mmringwidthyr -1, compared to 1.4mmyr -1 in LB. Trees are of relatively the same age due to lack of recruitment and widespread logging. Tree height, an indicator of site quality, is about 20\% less at the LB sites compared to BC, even though the trees are approximately the same ages. The average wetland elevation in the BC wetlands was about one meter with some areas higher than two meters, and was significantly higher than elevations in the LB (average sea level and 0.3m, respectively, in areas with and without input from Lake Pontchartrain). ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

Bacterial endophytes need to be explored for their potential applications in agricultural biotechnology. One of the potential applications of bacterial endophytes in agricultural is to enhance the growth of the agricultural crops. Hence, this study was undertaken to explore the plant growth promoting potential application of bacterial endophytes. Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the effect of endophytic bacteria from mangrove tree (Rhizophora apiculata Blume) for their efficacy in promoting seedling growth in rice. Materials and Methods: Eight endophytic bacterial isolates (EBIs) isolated from twig and petiole tissues of the mangrove were identified based on their 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene sequence homology. Separately, surface sterilized paddy seeds were treated with cell-free broth and cell suspension of the EBIs. Rice seedlings were analyzed by various bioassays and data was recorded. Results: The gene sequences of the isolates were closely related to two genera namely, Bacillus and Pantoea. Inoculation of EBIs from R. apiculata with rice seeds resulted in accelerated root and shoot growth with significant increase in chlorophyll content. Among the isolates, Pantoea ananatis (1MSE1) and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (3MPE1) had shown predominance of activity. Endophytic invasion was recognized by the non-host by rapid accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and was counteracted by the production of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and lipid peroxide. The results demonstrated that EBIs from mangrove tree can increase the fitness of the rice seedlings under controlled conditions. Conclusion: These research findings could be useful to enhance the seedling growth and could serve as foundation in further research on enhancing the growth of the rice crop using endophytic bacteria.},

Success of plantations is clearly related to the mycorrhizal status of the host trees over the years, from inoculated seedlings to truffle-producing trees. The experience gained in monitoring the ectomycorrhizal fungus status in cultivated truffle grounds has allowed us to develop an extensive catalogue of the ectomycorrhizal fungi present in truffle plantations. Herein, we summarize fungal community data from 85 references that represent different truffle studies in natural habitats and plantations. Approximately 25 \% of the ectomycorrhizae reported in the 85 references are common to most of the studies. In general, more fungal species are detected in productive plantations than in the non-productive ones. Truffle plantations display a diverse ectomycorrhizal fungal community, in which species of the genus Tuber are well represented. Tuber rufum and some members of Boletales are typically restricted to productive truffle plots. On the other hand, Hebeloma, Laccaria and Russula species are mostly associated with unproductive plots. Ectomycorrhizae belonging to Thelephoraceae are frequently found in mature truffle orchards but do not seem to affect sporocarp production. Several biotic and abiotic factors affect the ectomycorrhizal fungus communities associated with truffle orchards. Among them are plantation age, host species and its growth, the surrounding environment (particularly the presence of other ectomycorrhizal hosts), and plantation management. Understanding the ectomycorrhizal fungal communities inhabiting different plantations may give us clues about the dynamics of the targeted truffles and the possibility of identifying mycorrhizal fungal species that are good indicators of successful truffle plantations.},

Mangroove associated fungi live under stress conditions and are the potential source of chemically diverse metabolites. Some fungal metabolites served as lead molecules for the development of new anti-infective agents.

Mass production of planting material and successful germination of seeds are essential processes in rehabilitating these degraded mangrove forests. The present work was carried out to determine the efficacy of using propagule cuttings in mass production of plant materials and to determine the potential of using non mangrove soils to establish propagule cuttings for ornamental purposes. In addition air layering and stem cutting techniques were also tested for the mangrove propagation. Propagation of Rhizophora apiculata, by propagule cuttings, treated with root promoting hormones is feasible and it was possible to produce three saplings from one propagule. Indole Butyric Acid (IBA) (1000 ppm) was the best hormone concentration for inducing roots and IBA (1500 ppm) was the best for inducing shoots from propagule cuttings of R. apiculata. Air layering and stem cutting were performed with Avicennia marina and R. apiculata but none of the species was able to generate roots and therefore these vegetative propagation methods cannot be used for mass propagation of these mangrove species. Optimum growth medium and period of nursery care for mangrove saplings of R. apiculata, Ceriops tagal and Bruguiera sexangula were studied and the results revealed that best growth performance was in mangrove soils, i.e. 4.15 cm/ 4weeks for R. apiculata, 3.75 cm/ 4weeks for B. sexangula and 0.56 cm/ 4 weeks for C. tagal, while mangrove soils mixed with sand produced the second best growth for C. tagal and B. sexangula. Seedlings grown on terrestrial soils showed the lowest growth rate for all three mangrove species. However, no significant difference (P {$<$} 0.05) exists in growth rates of mangrove seedlings when grown in different growth media, indicating they can be grown with terrestrial soil for ornamental purposes. Potting media consisted only of mangrove soils as well as mangrove soils (1): sand (1), terrestrial soil alone and mangrove soil (1): terrestrial soil (1) can be used as nursery growth media for R. apiculata and C. tagal.}

Three hundred and forty-three fungi were identified by sequencing the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region of rDNA. Differences were observed in the frequencies of fungi isolated from the leaves and branches of these three different plant species sampled from the Bertioga oil spill-affected and the oil-unaffected mangrove sites in the summer and winter; these differences indicate a potential impact on fungal diversity in the study area due to the oil spill. The molecular identification of the fungi showed that the fungal community associated with these mangroves is composed of at least 34 different genera, the most frequent of which were Diaporthe, Colletotrichum, Fusarium, Trichoderma and Xylaria. The Shannon and the Chao1 indices \{[\}H'((95 \%)) = 4.00, H'((97 \%)) = 4.22, Chao1((95 \%)) = 204 and Chao1((97 \%)) = 603] indicated that the mangrove fungal community possesses a vast diversity and richness of endophytic fungi.

Bacterial caryolanes appear as the mirror images of typical plant caryolanes. Apparently plant and bacteria harbor stereodivergent biosynthetic pathways, which may be used as metabolic signatures. The discovery of plant-like volatile terpenes in endophytes not only is an important addition to the bacterial terpenome but may also point to complex molecular interactions in the plant-microbe association.}

  abstract = {Insect herbivory has been observed to be affected by habitat loss and fragmentation, although the mechanisms by which these anthropogenic disturbances affect this process are not well understood. To aid in clarifying this issue, we assessed the relation between forest cover and leaf damage caused by herbivorous insects on a representative tropical forest understory plant family, the Rubiaceae. We measured leaf area loss of Rubiaceae plants in 20 forest sites located in the Brazilian Atlantic forest, and also tested whether variation in forest cover, abundance of insectivorous birds (predators) and of Rubiaceae plants (resources) could explain the observed variation in leaf damage. Herbivory levels varied between 2.6 and 12.5 percent leaf area lost and increased with decreasing forest cover, whereas the other explanatory variables did not provide additional explanatory power. Therefore, forest loss appears to be the main driver of changes in local herbivory, and ecological processes such as top-down and bottom-up control may not account for the deforestation-related increase in herbivory levels. Other mechanisms, for example leaf quality and/or the influence of the adjoining land uses, have to be explored in future studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}

Although the WLES effectively summarizes variation in plant ecological strategies, little is known about its evolution. We reviewed estimates of natural selection and genetic variation for leaf traits to test whether the evolution of the WLES was limited by selection against unfit trait combinations or by genetic constraints. There was significant selection for leaf traits on both ends of the WLES spectrum, as well as significant genetic variation for these traits. In addition, genetic correlations between WLES traits were variable in strength and direction. These data suggest that genetic constraints have had a smaller role than selection in the evolution of the WLES. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.}

However, the relationship between Anatomical gsmax and operational gs under atmospheric conditions remains undefined. Leaf-level gas-exchange measurements were performed for six Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes that have different Anatomical gsmax profiles resulting from mutations or transgene activity in stomatal development. We found that Anatomical gsmax was an accurate prediction of gs under gas-exchange conditions that maximized stomatal opening, namely high-intensity light, low [CO2], and high relative humidity. Plants with different Anatomical gsmax had quantitatively similar responses to increasing [CO2] when gs was scaled to Anatomical gsmax. This latter relationship allowed us to produce and test an empirical model derived from the Ball-Woodrow-Berry equation that estimates gs as a function of Anatomical gsmax, relative humidity, and [CO2] at the leaf. The capacity to predict operational gs via Anatomical gsmax and the pore-specific short-term response to [CO2] demonstrates a precise link between stomatal development and leaf physiology. This connection should be useful to quantify the gas flux of plants in past, present, and future CO2 regimes based upon the anatomical features of stomata. © 2013 New Phytologist Trust.},

A five-way factorial treatment arrangement was used that included two substrates (inorganic, organic), two nutrient regimes (fertilized, not fertilized), two aeration levels (substrate aeration, no aeration), three oiling concentrations (0-, 5-, 10-l m-2 of South Louisiana Sweet Crude oil), and four vascular plant species (Alternanthera philoxeroides, Panicum hemitomon, Phragmites australis, Sagittaria lancifolia, and an unplanted control). Under the 5- and 10-l m-2 oiling concentrations, S. lancifolia displayed a short-term response of increased productivity, whereas P. hemitomon had the highest biomass production and photosynthetic rates at the end of the 18-month experiment. Overall plant growth and productivity, as well as oil degradation, were significantly higher in the inorganic substrate, indicating that biodegradation of oil spills in organic substrates may require a longer time period. Time-released fertilizer also stimulated plant productivity and resulted in higher soil respiratory quotients, suggestive of greater microbial activity, particularly in aerated mesocosms. The amount of oil remaining after 18 months was lowest in aerated and fertilized mesocosms containing either P. hemitomon or S. lancifolia and a substrate of low organic matter content. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

This research aimed to optimize isolation processes and culturing these bacteria afterwards. We compared several minimal and complex media in a screening. Beside the media themselves, two gelling agents and adding plant extract to media were investigated to enhance the number and diversity of endophytes as well as the growth capacity when regrown after isolation. In this work, 869 medium delivered the highest numbers of cultivable bacteria, as well as the highest diversity. When comparing gelling agents, no differences were observed in the numbers of bacteria. Adding plant extract to the media lead to a slight increase in diversity. However, when adding plant extract to improve the regrowth capacity, sharp increases of viable bacteria occurred in both rich and minimal media.}

  abstract = {Forested wetlands in Louisiana are hydrologically isolated from the Mississippi River, impacted by saltwater intrusion, and are sinking, resulting in more frequent flooding for longer periods. These problems are exacerbated in some areas by impoundment from man-made structures. Additionally, defoliation of the two dominant trees, baldcypress (Taxodium distichum L. Rich) and water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica L.), frequently occur during spring. In Louisiana, the baldcypress leafroller, BCLR (Archips goyerana Kruse) and the forest tent caterpillar, FTC (Malacosoma disstria Hubner) annually defoliate an average of 120,000 ha of baldcypress-tupelo swamps. In combination, these factors have led to severely degraded forested wetlands with reduced basal area, dieback and tree mortality over extensive, formerly productive swamplands. Restoration plans call for reintroducing Mississippi River water by diversions, to increase sediment elevation, promote natural regeneration, and enhance primary and secondary productivity. Nutrient augmentation of baldcypress and water tupelo trees in Maurepas Swamps (similar to NO3 - loading rates expected from 229 m3/s diversion) increased radial growth (cm2) of both species (especially baldcypress) in degraded forest stands. Nutrient augmentation also increased nitrogen in foliage (insect frass (feces), spring clipped leaves, and abscised leaf litter) for both tree species. Nitrogen content of canopy foliage and leaf litter was positively correlated with site health. These findings support hypotheses that swamps in southeastern Louisiana are nutrient limited, and existing trees can utilize, benefit, and act as nutrient sinks for nutrient-laden river water accompanying diversions. Defoliation of these swamp species, although not uniform among years, did not result in losses in radial growth, but increased overall litter deposition for baldcypress. An increase in nitrogen content in insect frass in response to nutrient augmentation indicates defoliator populations might increase as a result of nutrient influxes. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Recent work has shown that damage by leaf-cutting ants, a major Neotropical defoliator, is reduced to almost half in plants with high densities of endophytes. We investigated changes in the phenotype of leaves that could influence ants' behavior to result in the reduction of foliar damage. We produced cucumber seedlings with high and low densities of one common endophyte species, Colletotrichum tropicale. We used the leaves in bioassays and to compare chemical and physical leaf characteristics important for ants' food selection. Ants cut about one-third more area of cucumber leaves with lower densities of endophytes and removed c. 20\% more paper disks impregnated with the extracts of those leaves compared with leaves and disks from plants hosting the fungus. Colletotrichum tropicale colonization did not cause detectable changes in the composition of volatile compounds, cuticular waxes, nutrients or leaf toughness. Our study shows that endophytes changed leaf chemistry and suggests that compounds with relative low volatility released after leaf wounding are a major factor influencing foraging decisions by ants when choosing between plants with low or high endophyte loads. © 2013 New Phytologist Trust.},

This negative effect of endophytes on the ant's cultivar could be the result of direct fungal-fungal interaction or indirect reductions in the quality of leaves, the cultivar's growth substratum. To test for the indirect effects, we measured invitro growth rates of cultivars in media that contained sterilized leaf extracts from plants with high (Ehigh) and low (Elow) endophyte colonization. We found that, opposite to our expectations, cultivars grew significantly faster in Ehigh leaf extracts compared to Elow extracts. Our results suggest that endophyte-driven changes in leaf chemistry are a less likely explanation for the observed invivo reduction in the ant's symbiotic fungal growth and imply that the effect of direct endophyte-cultivar interactions inside nests are potentially more important. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.},

This approach has many advantages, as living microorganisms may be obtained for physiological investigations. In addition, these techniques allow the quantitative and qualitative assessment of the investigated environment. Quantitative analyses are done by plate count and the determination of abundance by the colony forming unit (CFU). Nevertheless, these techniques have many drawbacks that lead to an underestimation of the cell numbers and do not provide a comprehensive overview of the composition of the inhabiting microbiota. In the last decades, several molecular techniques have been developed enabling many advantages over the cultivation approach. Mainly PCR-based, fingerprinting techniques allow a qualitative detection and identification of the microbiota. In this study, we developed a real time PCR method as a simple, rapid and reliable tool to detect and quantify fungal abundance using the β-actin gene, which is known to appear as a single-copy gene in fungi. To this end, five different indoor thermal insulation materials applied for historical buildings that were previously tested for their bio-susceptibility against various fungi were subjected to qPCR analyses. The obtained results were compared with those obtained from a previous study investigating the bio-susceptibility of the insulation materials using classical cultivation experiments. Both results correlated well, revealing that Perlite plaster was the most suitable insulation material, showing the lowest fungal CFU and qPCR values. In contrast, insulations made of wood showed to be not recommendable from the microbiological point of view. In addition, the potential of qPCR was tested in other materials of cultural heritage, as old parchments, showing to be a suitable method for measuring fungal abundance in these delicate materials. © 2014 Ettenauer, Piñar, Tafer and Sterflinger.},

We studied the effect of a major insect herbivore (leaf-cutting ants, LCA) on plant fitness in several species of Monte Desert, assessing both the direct negative effect of ant defoliation and the indirect positive role of ants as soil improvers. To estimate the negative and positive effects on plants, we sampled 7000 plant fragments carried by the ants and analyzed the nutrient contents of refuse dumps in 15 ant nests. We estimated plant fitness measuring similar to 10,000 flowers and similar to 3600 fruits of 122 individuals from 7 of the most common plant species within the ant foraging area. First, we compared the fitness between plants growing on the nutrient-rich refuse dumps and co-specifics on adjacent non-nest soils. Second, using hierarchical confirmatory path analysis model, we analyzed how herbivory and nutrient content of refuse dumps affected plant fitness. We found that the fitness of plants growing on refuse dumps (a) was similar than those growing on adjacent non-nest soils, and (b) was unaffected by ant harvesting or by increments in nutrient content in a consistent way. In this dry habitat, the effect of LCA on plant fitness was complex and species-dependent. To explain this pattern, we discuss the role of plant compensation to foliar damage, the limited plant response to soil nutrients due to water stress and the potential high abundance plant consumers on ant refuse dumps. Our results illustrate the complexity of herbivore-plant interactions emphasizing the need of measuring direct and indirect effects of herbivory in field conditions to validate greenhouse experiments.}

The colonization patterns and activity of inoculated endophytes in rhizosphere and endosphere of host plant are among the primary factors that may influence the phytoremediation process. However, these colonization patterns and metabolic activity of the inoculated endophytes are in turn controlled by none other than the host plant itself. The present study aims to determine such an interaction specifically for plant-endophyte systems remediating crude oil-contaminated soil. A consortium (AP) of two oil-degrading endophytic bacteria (Acinetobacter sp. strain BRSI56 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain BRRI54) was inoculated to two grasses, Brachiaria mutica and Leptochloa fusca, vegetated in crude oil-contaminated soil. Colonization patterns and metabolic activity of the endophytes were monitored in the rhizosphere and endosphere of the plants. Bacterial augmentation enhanced plant growth and crude oil degradation. Maximum crude oil degradation (78 \%) was achieved with B. mutica plants inoculated with AP consortium. This degradation was significantly higher than those treatments, where plants and bacteria were used individually or L. fusca and endophytes were used in combination. Moreover, colonization and metabolic activity of the endophytes were higher in the rhizosphere and endosphere of B. mutica than L. fusca. The plant species affected not only colonization pattern and biofilm formation of the inoculated bacteria in the rhizosphere and endosphere of the host plant but also affected the expression of alkane hydroxylase gene, alkB. Hence, the investigation revealed that plant species can affect colonization patterns and metabolic activity of inoculated endophytic bacteria and ultimately the phytoremediation process.},

  abstract = {Summary                            The flowering plants – angiosperms – appeared during the Early Cretaceous period and within 10–30 Myr dominated the species composition of many floras worldwide. Emerging insights into the phylogenetics of development and discoveries of early angiosperm fossils are shedding increased light on the patterns and processes of early angiosperm evolution. However, we also need to integrate ecology, in particular how early angiosperms established a roothold in pre‐existing Mesozoic plant communities. These events were critical in guiding subsequent waves of angiosperm diversification during the Aptian–Albian. Previous pictures of the early flowering plant ecology have been diverse, ranging from large tropical rainforest trees, weedy drought‐adapted and colonizing shrubs, disturbance‐ and sun‐loving rhizomatous herbs, and, more recently, aquatic herbs; however, none of these images were tethered to a robust hypothesis of angiosperm phylogeny. Here, we synthesize our current understanding of early angiosperm ecology, focusing on patterns of functional ecology, by merging recent molecular phylogenetic studies and functional studies on extant ‘basal angiosperms’ with the picture of early angiosperm evolution drawn by the fossil record.

In plants, local speciation, where small populations split off from a large-ranged progenitor species, is thought to be the dominant mode, yet there are still few examples to verify speciation has occurred in this manner. A recently described morphological species in the yellow monkey flowers, Mimulus filicifolius, is an excellent candidate for local speciation because of its highly restricted geographical range. Mimulus filicifolius was formerly identified as a population of M. laciniatus due to similar lobed leaf morphology and rocky outcrop habitat. To investigate whether M. filicifolius is genetically divergent and reproductively isolated from M. laciniatus, we examined patterns of genetic diversity in ten nuclear and eight microsatellite loci, and hybrid fertility in M. filicifolius and its purported close relatives: M. laciniatus, M. guttatus and M. nasutus. We found that M. filicifolius is genetically divergent from the other species and strongly reproductively isolated from M. laciniatus. We conclude that M. filicifolius is an independent rock outcrop specialist despite being morphologically and ecologically similar to M. laciniatus, and that its small geographical range nested within other wide-ranging members of the M. guttatus species complex is consistent with local speciation.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims The genetic basis of leaf shape has long interested botanists because leaf shape varies extensively across the plant kingdom and this variation is probably adaptive. However, knowledge of the genetic architecture of leaf shape variation in natural populations remains limited. This study examined the genetic architecture of leaf shape diversification among three edaphic specialists in the Mimulus guttatus species complex. Lobed and narrow leaves have evolved from the entire, round leaves of M. guttatus in M. laciniatus, M. nudatus and a polymorphic serpentine M. guttatus population (M2L). Methods Bulk segregant analysis and next-generation sequencing were used to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that underlie leaf shape in an M. laciniatus∈×∈M. guttatus F2 population. To determine whether the same QTLs contribute to leaf shape variation in M. nudatus and M2L, F2s from M. guttatus∈×∈M. nudatus and lobed M2L∈×∈unlobed M. guttatus crosses were genotyped at QTLs from the bulk segregant analysis. Key Results Narrow and lobed leaf shapes in M. laciniatus, M. nudatus and M. guttatus are controlled by overlapping genetic regions. Several promising leaf shape candidate genes were found under each QTL. Conclusions The evolution of divergent leaf shape has taken place multiple times in the M. guttatus species complex and is associated with the occupation of dry, rocky environments. The genetic architecture of elongated and lobed leaves is similar across three species in this group. This may indicate that parallel genetic evolution from standing variation or new mutations is responsible for the putatively adaptive leaf shape variation in Mimulus.},

  abstract = {Identifying the individual loci and mutations that underlie adaptation to extreme environments has long been a goal of evolutionary biology. However, finding the genes that underlie adaptive traits is difficult for several reasons. First, because many traits and genes evolve simultaneously as populations diverge, it is difficult to disentangle adaptation from neutral demographic processes. Second, finding the individual loci involved in any trait is challenging given the respective limitations of quantitative and population genetic methods. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Hendrick et~al. (2016) overcome these difficulties and determine the genetic basis of microgeographic adaptation between geothermal vent and nonthermal populations of Mimulus guttatus in Yellowstone National Park. The authors accomplish this by combining population and quantitative genetic techniques, a powerful, but labour-intensive, strategy for identifying individual causative adaptive loci that few studies have used (Stinchcombe \& Hoekstra ). In a previous common garden experiment (Lekberg et~al. 2012), thermal M.~guttatus populations were found to differ from their closely related nonthermal neighbours in various adaptive phenotypes including trichome density. Hendrick et~al. (2016) combine quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, population genomic scans for selection and admixture mapping to identify a single genetic locus underlying differences in trichome density between thermal and nonthermal M.~guttatus. The candidate gene, R2R3 MYB, is homologous to genes involved in trichome development across flowering plants. The major trichome QTL, Tr14, is also involved in trichome density differences in an independent M.~guttatus population comparison (Holeski et~al. 2010) making this an example of parallel genetic evolution.},

  abstract = {The genetic architecture of local adaptation has been of central interest to evolutionary biologists since the modern synthesis. In addition to classic theory on the effect size of adaptive mutations by Fisher, Kimura and Orr, recent theory addresses the genetic architecture of local adaptation in the face of ongoing gene flow. This theory predicts that with substantial gene flow between populations local adaptation should proceed primarily through mutations of large effect or tightly linked clusters of smaller effect loci. In this study, we investigate the genetic architecture of divergence in flowering time, mating system-related traits, and leaf shape between Mimulus laciniatus and a sympatric population of its close relative M.~guttatus. These three traits are probably involved in M.~laciniatus' adaptation to a dry, exposed granite outcrop environment. Flowering time and mating system differences are also reproductive isolating barriers making them 'magic traits'. Phenotypic hybrids in this population provide evidence of recent gene flow. Using next-generation sequencing, we generate dense SNP markers across the genome and map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) involved in flowering time, flower size and leaf shape. We find that interspecific divergence in all three traits is due to few QTL of large effect including a highly pleiotropic QTL on chromosome 8. This QTL region contains the pleiotropic candidate gene TCP4 and is involved in ecologically important phenotypes in other Mimulus species. Our results are consistent with theory, indicating that local adaptation and reproductive isolation with gene flow should be due to few loci with large and pleiotropic effects.},

Here, we investigate the ecological variables and traits that underlie Mimulus laciniatus’ adaptation to granite outcrops compared to its sympatric, mesic-adapted progenitor, Mimulus guttatus. We use fine-scale measurements of soil moisture and herbivory to examine differences in selective forces between the species’ habitats, and measure selection on flowering time, flower size, plant height, and leaf shape in a reciprocal transplant using M.~laciniatus~× M.~guttatus F4 hybrids. We find that differences in drought and herbivory drive survival differences between habitats, that M.~laciniatus and M.~guttatus are each better adapted to their native habitat, and differential habitat selection on flowering time, plant stature, and leaf shape. Although early flowering time, small stature, and lobed leaf shape underlie plant fitness in M.~laciniatus’ seasonally dry environment, increased plant size is advantageous in a competitive mesic environment replete with herbivores like M.~guttatus’. Given that we observed divergent selection between habitats in the direction of species differences, we conclude that adaptation to different microhabitats is an important component of reproductive isolation in this sympatric species pair.},

In addition to offering leaf disks to the ants, we offered large pieces of leaves to assess the effect of cutting leaves on food choices. Leaf-cutters responded differently to each plant species, preferring Virola koschyni Warburg (Myristicaceae) and Hyeronima alchorneoides Allemao (Euphorbiaceae) over Stryphnodendrum microstachyum Poeppig gr Endlicher (Mimosoideae), Pentaclethra macroloba Willdenow (Fabaceae) and Vochysia ferruginea Martius (Vochysiaceae). In agreement with previous studies, interspecific differences among the tree species in water and saponin content appeared to account for the observed ant preferences among the five tree species: leaf-cutter ants preferred leaves and disks with more water and less saponins and the five tree species varied significantly in these traits. An observed positive correlation between preference and phenolic/nitrogen ratio appears to be spurious, and is instead due to a negative correlation between water content and nitrogen content. For the first time, Atta nest location has been shown to affect consumption: nests located in partial shade removed more leaf material than those from the sun plots. However, nest location had no effect on preference ranking of the tree species tested. Pieces of leaves from all the tree species grown in partial shade were significantly more removed than those trees grown in full sun. Leaf age, toughness, leaf specific weights, ant activity, and colony were not correlated with food choices. Because of the observed preferences, the five tree species should not be considered as equal candidates for plantation purposes. However, complete characterization of the candidate status of tree species for plantations in the neotropics must include information on the ability of such species to tolerate pest attacks in addition to their natural defenses to attack.}

The " pathobiome " breaks down the concept of " one pathogen = one disease " and highlights the role of the microbiome, more specifically certain members within the microbiome, in causing pathogenesis. The development of next generation sequencing has allowed large data sets to be amassed describing the microbial communities of many organisms and the field of coral biology is no exception. However, the choices made in the analytical process and the interpretation of these data can significantly affect the outcome and the overall conclusions drawn. In this review we explore the implications of these difficulties, as well as highlighting analytical tools developed in other research fields (such as network analysis) which hold substantial potential in helping to develop a deeper understanding of the role of the microbiome in disease in corals. We also make the case that standardization of methods will substantially improve the collective gain in knowledge across research groups.},

Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved.

Microbes may influence ecosystems through their effects on the functional trait values and population dynamics of their plant hosts. These effects may feed back on symbiont evolution by altering transmission rates of symbionts and scale up to ecosystem processes and services.

The mechanisms of priority effects fall into two categories, niche preemption and niche modification, and the conditions for historical contingency by priority effects can be organized into two groups, those regarding regional species pool properties and those regarding local population dynamics. Specifically, two requirements must be satisfied for historical contingency to occur: The regional pool contains species that can together cause priority effects, and local dynamics are rapid enough for early-arriving species to preempt or modify niches before other species arrive. Organizing current knowledge this way reveals an outstanding key question: How are regional species pools that yield priority effects generated and maintained?},

Endophyte community structure (species diversity: richness and relative abundances) within the plant is dynamic and is influenced by abiotic and biotic factors such as soil conditions, biogeography, plant species, microbe–microbe interactions and plant–microbe interactions, both at local and larger scales. Plant-growth-promoting bacterial endophytes (PGPBEs) have been identified, but the predictive success at positively influencing plant growth in field conditions has been limited. Concurrent to the development of modern molecular techniques, the goal of predicting an organism’s ability to promote plant growth can perhaps be realized by more thorough examination of endophyte community dynamics. This paper reviews the drivers of endophyte community structure relating to plant growth promotion, the mechanisms of plant growth promotion, and the current and future use of molecular techniques to study these communities.},

  abstract = {Summary Herbaceous plants harbour species-rich communities of asymptomatic endophytic fungi. While some of these endophytes are entomopathogenic, many are not, and remarkably little is known about how the presence of these fungi in plant tissues affects phytophagous insects. Here we show through a meta-analysis that both entomopathogenic and non-entomopathogenic endophytes have a negative effect on insect herbivores. Growth and performance of polyphagous and sucking insects are reduced by non-entomopathogenic endophytes, but monophages are unaffected, likely because the latter are better adapted to secondary metabolites produced or induced by the fungi. Furthermore, studies using excised leaves report weaker effects than those with intact plants, likely caused by chemical changes being masked by leaf excision. Most surprisingly, endophyte infection of seeds produces the greatest effect on insect herbivores in subsequent mature plants, even though the usual mode of fungal transmission is infection of leaves by air-borne spores. We conclude that these ubiquitous hidden fungi may be important bodyguards of plants. However, in order to fully understand their roles in plant protection, we must be aware that minor differences in experimental design can lead to contradictory results.

Fungi found on collected wood samples were analyzed using a combination of morphological and molecular techniques. Almost 90\% of the samples were colonized by fungi. The total number of recorded taxa, which amounted to 57 in the late 1990s, has now risen to 93. Wood-inhabiting marine fungi are good producers of ligninolytic enzymes, which can degrade several aromatic and recalcitrant environmental pollutants. In light of bioremediation technologies, this study also evaluated the potential of the isolated strains to remediate complex hydrocarbon substrates. Seventeen isolates were shown to be able to grow on hydrocarbon media as a sole carbon source; enhanced performances were achieved in the presence of NaCl, suggesting that these fungi adapt well to marine conditions and confirming that salt can trigger specific metabolic pathways in marine fungi.}

In a future faced with substantial climate change, endophytes have the potential to play an important role in plant stress resistance. Understanding both the distributions of endophytes and their functioning in symbiosis with plants are key aspects of predicting their role in an altered climate. Methods: Here we characterized endophytes in grasses across a steep precipitation gradient to examine the relative importance of environmental and spatial factors in structuring endophyte communities. We also tested how 20 endophytes isolated from drier and wetter regions performed in symbiosis with grass seedlings under high and low soil moisture in the greenhouse. Key results: Environmental factors related to historical and current precipitation were the most important predictors of endophyte communities in the field. On average, endophytic fungi from western sites also reduced plant water loss in the greenhouse compared to fungi from eastern sites. However, there was substantial variability in how individual endophytic taxa affected plant traits under high and low water availability, with up to two orders of magnitude difference in the plasticity of plant traits conferred by the different fungal taxa. Conclusions: While species sorting appears to largely explain local endophyte community composition, their function in symbiosis is not predictable from local environmental conditions. The development of a predictive framework for endophyte function will require further study of individual fungal taxa and genotypes across environmental gradients.},

A total of 65 unique leaf endophytes were isolated and identified based on ITS and LSU regions of rDNA. Mean annual rainfall and temperature were the primary drivers of endophyte richness and community composition, followed by annual weather conditions. In contrast, little explanatory value was provided by plant host traits, vegetation structure, or spatial factors.

In field surveys of a Caribbean mangrove forest in Panama, Avicennia germinans suffered much less damage from foliar diseases than did Laguncularia racemosa or Rhizophora mangle. Similarly, Avicennia leaves supported the least superficial fungal growth, endophytic colonization, and diversity, followed by Laguncularia and Rhizophora. Host specificity of leaf-colonizing fungi was greater than expected at random. We hypothesize that the different salt tolerance mechanisms in the three mangrove species may differentially regulate fungal colonization. The mangroves differ in their salt tolerance mechanisms such that Avicennia (which excretes salt through leaf glands) has the highest salinity of residual rain water on leaves, Laguncularia (which accumulates salt in the leaves) has the greatest bulk salt concentration, and Rhizophora (which excludes salt at the roots) has little salt associated with leaves. The high salt concentrations associated with leaves of Avicennia and Laguncularia, but not the low salinity of Rhizophora, were sufficient to inhibit the germination of many fungi associated with mangrove forests.},

Experimental inoculations with fungal pathogens of plant leaves in a tropical rain forest show that most fungal pathogens are polyphagous but that most plant species in a local community are resistant to any given pathogen. The likelihood that a pathogen can infect two plant species decreases continuously with phylogenetic distance between the plants, even to ancient evolutionary distances. This phylogenetic signal in host range allows us to predict the likely host range of plant pathogens in a local community, providing an important tool for plant ecology, design of agronomic systems, quarantine regulations in international trade, and risk analysis of biological control agents. In particular, the results suggest that the rate of spread and ecological impacts of a disease through a natural plant community will depend strongly on the phylogenetic structure of the community itself and that current regulatory approaches strongly underestimate the local risks of global movement of plant pathogens or their hosts.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Abstract. Ecologists have long been interested in identifying and testing factors that drive top-down or bottom-up regulation of communities. Most studies have focused on factors that directly exert top-down (e.g., grazing) or bottom-up (e.g., nutrient availability) control on primary production. For example, recent studies in salt marshes have demonstrated that fronts of Littoraria irrorata periwinkles can overgraze Spartina alterniflora and convert marsh to mudflat. The importance of indirect, bottom-up effects, particularly facilitation, in enhancing primary production has also recently been explored. Previous field studies separately revealed that fiddler crabs, which burrow to depths of more than 30 cm, can oxygenate marsh sediments and redistribute nutrients, thereby relieving the stress of anoxia and enhancing S. alterniflora growth. However, to our knowledge, no studies to date have explored how non trophic facilitators can mediate top-down effects (i.e., grazing) on primary-producer biomass. We conducted a field study testing whether fiddler crabs can facilitate S. alterniflora growth sufficiently to mitigate overgrazing by periwinkles and thus sustain S. alterniflora marsh. As inferred from contrasts to experimental plots lacking periwinkles and fiddler crabs, periwinkles alone exerted top-down control of total aboveground biomass and net growth of 5. alterniflora. When fiddler crabs were included, they counteracted the effects of periwinkles on net S. alterniflora growth. Sediment oxygen levels were greater and S. alterniflora belowground biomass was lower where fiddler crabs were present, implying that fiddler crab burrowing enhanced S. alterniflora growth. Consequently, in the stressful interior S. alterniflora marsh, where subsurface soil anoxia is widespread, fiddler crab facilitation can mitigate top-down control by periwinkles and can limit and possibly prevent loss of biogenically structured marsh habitat and its ecosystem services.},

One or more participating mutualists may alter their host's phenotype, resulting in a shift in the host's ecological interactions with all other mutualists involved. Understanding the functional interplay of mutualists associated with the same host remains an important challenge in biology. Here, we show belowground nitrogen-fixing rhizobia on lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) alter their host plant's defensive mutualism with aboveground ants. We induced extrafloral nectar (EFN), an indirect defense acting through ant attraction. We also measured various nutritive and defensive plant traits, biomass, and counted ants on rhizobial and rhizobia-free plants. Rhizobia increased plant protein as well as cyanogenesis, a direct chemical defense against herbivores, but decreased EFN. Ants were significantly more attracted to rhizobia-free plants, and our structural equation model shows a strong link between rhizobia and reduced EFN as well as between EFN and ants: the sole path to ant recruitment. The rhizobia-mediated effects on simultaneously expressed defensive plant traits indicate rhizobia can have significant bottom-up effects on higher trophic levels. Our results show belowground symbionts play a critical and underestimated role in determining aboveground mutualistic interactions.},

A5 was isolated and identified from the roots of Kandelia candel. When this fungus was added, it protected the growth of K. candel under Cu stress. This can be illustrated by analyzing chlorophyll A and B, RWC and WSD to leaves of K. candel. Purpureocillium sp. A5 reduces uptake of Cu in K. candel and changes the pH characterization of soil. Furthermore, A5 increase the concentration of Cu complexes in soil, and it enhanced the concentration of carbonate-bound Cu, Mn–Fe complexes Cu and organic-bound Cu in soil. Nevertheless, a significant reduction of the Cu ion was noted among A5-treated plants. This study is significant and illustrates a promising potential use for environmental remediation of endophytes, and also may partially explain the large capacity of mangrove ecosystems in retaining heavy metals.}

In this study, the diversity of foliar endophytic fungi (FEF) of the southern temperate tree Embothrium coccineum (Proteaceae), as well as their role in plant protection in nature was determined. Fungal endophytes were isolated from 40 asymptomatic leaves by the culture method for molecular identification of the 18S rRNA gene. A relationship between FEF frequency and plant protection was evaluated in juveniles of E. coccineum . Fungal endophyte frequency was estimated using real-time PCR analyses to determine endophyte DNA content per plant. A total of 178 fungal isolates were identified, with sequence data revealing 34 different operational taxonomic units (OTUs). A few common taxa dominated the fungal endophyte community, whereas most taxa qualified as rare. A significant positive correlation between plant protection (evaluated in terms of percentage of leaf damage) and FEF frequency was found. Furthermore, in vitro confrontation assays indicated that FEF were able to inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens. The data showed a relatively high diversity of fungal endophytes associated with leaves of E. coccineum , and suggest a positive relationship between fungal endophyte frequencies in leaves and host protection in nature.},

In this review, we first examine the ecology and behavior of bacteria that reside on leaf surfaces. Next, we discuss the ecological implications of foliar bacteria that reside in interior portions of leaf tissues. Later, we consider the studies on foliar bacteria in tropical habitats to date. Finally, we examine evidence regarding the potential roles of foliar bacteria in structuring tropical plant communities. Bacteria colonize the phyllosphere via animal vectors or passively from soil, wind, or rain, though there are too few data to determine the relative contributions of these sources to the phyllosphere. Additionally, the degree to which parent plants transmit bacteria to offspring via seed remains unknown. We predict that high temperature, high humidity, low UV radiation, and leaf architecture in the tropical understory enable tropical leaves to support more abundant and diverse bacterial communities compared to temperate leaves. While the extent of competitive interactions among bacteria remains poorly resolved, evidence from agricultural crop species and Arabidopsis thaliana suggests that these interactions cause niche partitioning based on carbon use. The degree to which phyllobacteria and endophytes of tropical plants are pathogenic versus mutualistic or neutral remains unexplored. We hypothesize, however, that the detrimental impact of bacterial pathogens ultimately increases as the abundance of single host tree species increases, which can promote and maintain plant diversity in tropical forests.},

Nonetheless, the degree to which bacterial communities are benign, harmful, or beneficial to plants in situ is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that the net effect of reducing bacterial abundance and diversity would vary substantially among host species (from harmful to beneficial) and this would be strongly mediated by soil resource availability. To test this, we monitored tree seedling growth responses to commercial antibiotics among replicated resource supply treatments (N, P, K) in a tropical forest in Panama for 29 months. We applied either antibiotics or control water to replicated seedlings of five common tree species (Alseis blackiana, Desmopsis panamensis, Heisteria concinna, Sorocea affinis, and Tetragastris panamensis). These antibiotic treatments significantly reduced both the abundance and diversity of bacteria epiphytically as well as endophytically. Overall, the effect of antibiotics on performance was highly host specific. Applying antibiotics increased growth for three species by as much as 49\% (Alseis, Heisteria, and Tetragastris), decreased growth for a fourth species by nearly 20\% (Sorocea), and had no impact on a fifth species (Desmopsis). Perhaps more importantly, the degree to which foliar bacteria were harmful or not varied with soil resource supply. Specifically, applying antibiotics had no effect when potassium was added but increased growth rate by almost 40\% in the absence of potassium. Alternatively, phosphorus enrichment caused the effect of bacteria to switch from being primarily beneficial to harmful or vice versa, but this depended entirely on the presence or absence of nitrogen enrichment (i.e., important and significant interactions). Our results are the first to demonstrate that the net effect of reducing the abundance and diversity of bacteria can have very strong positive and negative effects on seedling performance. Moreover, these effects were clearly mediated by soil resource availability. Though speculative, we suggest that foliar bacteria may interact with soil fertility to comprise an important, yet cryptic dimension of niche differentiation, which can have important implications for species coexistence.},

Studies of both pathogenic and beneficial plant microbes have documented wide-ranging effects on herbivore behavior and performance. Some studies, for example, have reported enhanced insect-repellent traits or reduced performance of herbivores on microbe-associated plants, while others have documented increased herbivore attraction or performance. Insect herbivores frequently rely on plant cues during foraging and oviposition, suggesting that plant-associated microbes affecting these cues can indirectly influence herbivore preference. We review and synthesize recent literature to provide new insights into the ways pathogenic and beneficial plant-associated microbes alter visual, olfactory, and gustatory cues of plants that affect host-plant selection by insect herbivores. We discuss the underlying mechanisms, ecological implications, and future directions for studies of plant-microbial symbionts that indirectly influence herbivore behavior by altering plant traits.},

  abstract = {The cultivation of Lactarius deliciosus (saffron milk cap) in New Zealand began in 2002 when fruiting bodies were produced in an Otago plantation of Pinus radiata seedlings artificially mycorrhized by L. deliciosus. In 2007, 42 P. radiata seedlings mycorrhized by L. deliciosus under controlled conditions were planted in a grass field at Plant and Food Research (Lincoln, Canterbury). The effects of pine bark mulch application and initial degree of mycorrhization of seedlings were examined to determine their influence on tree growth, development of mycorrhizae (i.e. their multiplication on the root system and their degree of branching) and fruiting body production. Mulch application increased tree growth significantly over 4 years. High initial mycorrhization slightly stimulated tree growth over 2 years. The initial degree of mycorrhization was positively, but not strongly, related to the persistence and development of L. deliciosus mycorrhizae and rhizomorphs based on root sample analyses 2 years after planting. However, mulching strongly reduced the proportion of highly branched L. deliciosus mycorrhizae compared with poorly ramified ones. A positive correlation was observed between the fruiting of L. deliciosus and the development of mycorrhizae. Mulching delayed the onset of fruiting body production. In 2010, fruiting bodies were produced only from non-mulched trees with eight of these (38 \%) producing a total of 12 fruiting bodies. In 2011, 19 non-mulched trees (90 \%) and 9 mulched trees (45 \%) produced 143 and 47 fruiting bodies, respectively, totalling 190 fruiting bodies. By 2012, 19 non-mulched trees (90 \%) and 13 mulched trees (65 \%) produced 333 and 236 fruiting bodies, respectively, totalling 569 fruiting bodies (c. 30 kg). This study presents new information on factors influencing the onset of fruiting and the development of yields in a plantation of P. radiata mycorrhized by L. deliciosus. Projected yields as high as c. 300 kg/ha from the third year of production reiterate the feasibility of farming saffron milk cap in P. radiata plantations in New Zealand. Continued monitoring of this site and development of similar trials will provide important knowledge for the optimisation of yields in commercial saffron milk cap orchards.}

  abstract = {? 2015 The Royal Entomological Society.1. All plants form symbioses with microfungi, known as endophytes, which live within plant tissues. Numerous studies have documented endophyte-herbivore antagonism in grass systems, but plant-endophyte-insect interactions are highly variable for forbs and woody plants. 2. The net effect of endophytes on insect herbivory may be modified by their interactions with higher trophic levels, such as predators. Including these multitrophic dynamics may explain some of the variability among endophyte studies of non-grass plants, which are currently based exclusively on bitrophic studies. 3. The abundance of natural foliar endophytes in a Neotropical vine was manipulated and beetles were fed high or low endophyte diets. Experimental assays assessed whether dietary endophyte load affected beetle growth, leaf consumption, and susceptibility to ant predation. 4. Beetles feeding on high- versus low-endophyte plants had almost identical growth and leaf consumption rates. 5. In a field bioassay, however, it was discovered that feeding on an endophyte-rich diet increased a beetle's odds of capture by predatory ants nine-fold. 6. Endophytes could thus provide an indirect, enemy-mediated form of plant defence that operates even against specialist herbivores. We argue that a multitrophic approach is necessary to untangle the potentially diverse types of endophyte defence among plants.},

Increases in average water temperature (1.21°C since 1946), chlorophyll a (300\% since 1979), and an influential group of zooplankton grazers (335\% increase in cladocerans since 1946) may have important implications for nutrient cycling and food web dynamics.

Changes in Lake Baikal are particularly significant as an integrated signal of long-term regional warming, because this lake is expected to be among those most resistant to climate change due to its tremendous volume.

In the present work, we isolated, identified and characterized, a total of 78 fungal isolates harboring inside the leaf tissues of R. mucronata. Molecular identification using the nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribe spacer (ITS) sequences returned with high similarity matches to known sequences in the GenBank. Maximum likelihood analysis revealed the phylogenetic relationship of all isolates from this study. Most of the dominating fungal endophytes were from the genera Pestalotiopsis, followed by Alternaria and Cladosporium. Six isolates representing the genera Alternaria, Fusarium, Nigrospora, Pestalotiopsis, Phoma, and Xylaria, were further screened for their antagonism activities. Dual culture test assay revealed their inhibition percentages against the phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium solani between 45-66\%, and 0.8-23\% when using non-volatile test assay. Of the six isolates, only Fusarium lateritium and Xylaria sp. showed antibacterial activities against the pathogenic bacteria, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus, with the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) ranging from 0.5 to 2 mg/mL. The DPPH radical scavenging assay recorded a high level of antioxidant activity in Xylaria sp., 3-fold above that of F. lateritium. We demonstrate for the first time, two members belonging to the endophytic fungal community in the tropical mangrove species that have potential use as antagonists and antibacterial agents for future biotechnological applications.},

We investigated the effects of the endophyte Chaetomium cochlioides on leaf chemistry in Cirsium arvense. Plants were sprayed with spores; leaf material from both subsequent new growth and the sprayed leaves was analysed 2 wk later. Infection frequency was 91\% and 63\% for sprayed and new growth, respectively, indicating that C. cochlioides rapidly infects new foliage. Metabolomic analyses revealed marked changes in leaf chemistry with infection, especially in new growth. Changes in several novel oxylipin metabolites were detected, including arabi-dopsides reported here for the first time in a plant species other than Arabidopsis thaliana, and a jasmonate-containing galactolipid. The production of these metabolites in response to endophyte presence, particularly in newly infected foliage, suggests that endophytes elicit similar chemical responses in plants to those usually produced following wounding, herbivory and pathogen invasion. Whether en-dophytes benefit their hosts may depend on a complex series of chemically mediated interac-tions between the plant, the endophyte, other microbial colonists and natural enemies.},

  abstract = {Phytoremediation technologies based on the combined action of plants and the microbial communities that they support within the rhizosphere hold promise in the remediation of land and waterways contaminated with hydrocarbons but they have not yet been adopted in large-scale remediation strategies. In this review plant and microbial degradative capacities, viewed as a continuum, have been dissected in order to identify where bottle-necks and limitations exist. Phenols, anilines and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were selected as the target classes of mol-ecule for consideration, in part because of their common patterns of distribution, but also because of the urgent need to develop techniques to overcome their toxicity to human health. Depending on the chemical and physical properties of the pollut-ant, the emerging picture suggests that plants will draw pollut-ants including PAHs into the plant rhizosphere to varying extents via the transpiration stream. Mycorrhiz.osphere-bacteria arid -fungi may play a crucial role in establishing plants in degraded eco-systems. Within the rhizosphere, microbial degradative activi-ties prevail in order to extract energy and carbon skeletons from the pollutants for microbial cell growth. There has been little systematic analysis of the changing dynamics of pollutant deg-radation within the rhizosphere; however, the importance of plants in supplying oxygen and nutrients to the rhizosphere via fine roots, and of the beneficial effect of microorganisms on plant root growth is stressed. In addition to their role in supporting rhizospheric degradative activities, plants may possess a limited capacity to transport some of the more mobile pollutants into roots and shoots via fine roots. In those situations where uptake does occur (i.e. only limited microbial activity in the rhizosphere) there is good evi-dence that the pollutant may be metabolised. However, plant uptake is frequently associated with the inhibition of plant growth and an increasing tendency to oxidant stress. Pollutant tolerance seems to correlate with the ability to deposit large quantities of pollutant metabolites in the 'bound' residue frac-tion of plant cell walls compared to the vacuole. In this regard, k, particular attention is paid to the activities of peroxidases, laccases, cytochromes P450, glucosyltransferases and ABC trans-il porters. However, despite the seemingly large diversity of these B proteins, direct proof of their participation in the metabolism B of industrial aromatic pollutants is surprisingly scarce and little is known about their control in the overall metabolic scheme. ]] Little is known about the bioavailability of bound metabolites; however, there may be a need to prevent their movement into wildlife food chains. In this regard, the application to harvested plants of composting techniques based on the degradative ca-pacity of white-rot fungi merits attention. I},

Direct, experimentally controlled comparisons of endophyte free (E-) and endophyte containing (E+) plant tissues in T. cacao show that foliar endophytes (FEF) that commonly occur in healthy host leaves enhance host defenses against foliar damage due to the pathogen (Phytophthora palmivora). Similarly, root inoculations with commonly occurring AMF also reduce foliar damage due to the same pathogen. These results suggest that endophytic fungi can play a potentially important mutualistic role by augmenting host defensive responses against pathogens. There are two broad classes of potential mechanisms by which endophytes could contribute to host protection: (1) inducing or increasing the expression of intrinsic host defense mechanisms and (2) providing additional sources of defense, extrinsic to those of the host (e.g., endophytebased chemical antibiosis). The degree to which either of these mechanisms predominates holds distinct consequences for the evolutionary ecology of host-endophyte-pathogen relationships. More generally, the growing recognition that plants are composed of a mosaic of plant and fungal tissues holds a series of implications for the study of plant defense, physiology, and genetics. ? 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.},

In this study, the consumption and herbivory rates for the entire leaf-cutting ant (Atta colombica, Formicidae) population in an old secondary forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI) in Panama were determined over 15 mo (on average 49 colonies). The number of harvested leaf fragments was calculated from monthly refuse deposition rates of the colonies and the regression between refuse deposition and harvesting rates. The inclusion of fragment characteristics (proportion of leaf fragments in the harvest, average fragment weight, and area) allowed us to calculate consumption and herbivory rates at colony, population, and ecosystem levels. The A. colombica population harvested 13.2 tons of biomass/yr and 13.1 ha of leaf area/yr, and deposited 9.4 tons of refuse material/yr. Rates varied considerably among colonies. At the ecosystem level, i.e., per forest area, herbivory rates were 132 kg biomass/ha/yr and 1310 m 2 foliage/ha/yr. For the area on BCI where A. colombica occurs (100 ha), this is equivalent to 2.1 percent of the foliage area in the forest or 1.7 percent of the annual leaf-area production. This value is considerably lower than previously published estimates of leaf-cutting ant herbivory rates in tropical forests. © 2007 The Author(s).},

To provide a broader context for understanding grass-endophyte associations we characterized fungal endophyte communities inhabiting foliage of 11 species of phylogenetically diverse C3 grasses in the understory of a lowland tropical forest at Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Our sample included members of early-arising subfamilies of Poaceae that are endemic to forests, as well as more recently arising subfamilies that transitioned to open environments. Isolation on culture media and direct PCR and cloning revealed that these grasses harbor species-rich and phylogenetically diverse communities that lack the endophytic Clavicipitaceae known from diverse woodland and pasture grasses in the temperate zone. Both the incidence and diversity of endophytes was consistent among grass species regardless of subfamily, clade affiliation or ancestral habitat use.

  abstract = {Coastal swamps are among the rapidly vanishing wetland habitats in Louisiana due to accelerated sea-level rise and hydrological alterations that alter the natural flooding regime. In particular, the swamp forests of Lake Maurepas, Louisiana, have degraded considerably, and research regarding their condition might suggest approaches for their restoration. We measured forest structure, species composition, tree mortality, annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP) of woody species, and aboveground biomass allocation to leaf litter and wood, and soil strength at forty study plots within the Lake Maurepas basin over 5 years to evaluate the current condition of this coastal forested wetland. Local measures of salinity and regional measures of flooding were used to predict ANPP and aboveground biomass allocation. The 5-year study period included an intense drought as well as years characterized by hurricane-induced flooding. The forty study plots could be divided into four distinct habitat clusters based on standing biomass, structural variables, and salinity. The majority of the plots were co-dominated by Taxodium distichum and Nyssa aquatica. Acer rubrum var. drummondii and Fraxinus pennsylvanica were common mid-story species throughout the western and southern parts of the study area, while Salix nigra, Morella cerifera, and Triadica sebiferum were more important at the more degraded plots in the eastern part of the basin. Annual mean soil salinity reached unprecedented level (2-5 psu) during the drought and cumulative tree mortality reached up to 85\% in areas characterized by frequent saltwater intrusions. The ANPP was higher during the drought period in 2000-2001 than during subsequent years, and was dominated by T. distichum. At most sampling plots, litter production exceeded wood production annually. A negative correlation between aboveground biomass allocation to litter and flooding indicated that biomass allocation shifted from litter toward wood during wet years. Overall, the majority of the plots sampled produced less than 400 g m-2 yr-1 of aboveground biomass annually due to the interacting negative effects of saltwater intrusion and prolonged flooding with nutrient-poor water. Reintroduction of Mississippi River water to the Maurepas system has the potential to benefit these swamps greatly by restoring a greater flow of nutrients, sediments, and fresh water through the wetlands. The historically slow (i.e., multi-decadal) process of swamp deterioration was greatly sped by low salinity (i.e., 2-5 psu) saltwater intrusions during a drought in 1999-2000. The majority of the coastal swamps in the Pontchartrain Basin are deteriorating, and most of this swamp area will be lost to open water in the foreseeable future if no restoration action is taken. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We found that both developmental stage and simulated insect damage affected trichome production, but in different ways. Plants were more likely to produce at least some trichomes on later leaves than on earlier leaves, regardless of damage. Damage did not affect the average probability of producing trichomes, but it did increase the density of hairs on trichome-positive plants. We mapped trichome quantitative trait loci (QTL) by selectively genotyping a large panel of recombinant inbred lines derived from two highly divergent populations. Several highly pleiotropic QTL influenced multiple aspects of the trichome phenotype (constitutive, developmental, and/or plastic responses). Only one of the QTL influenced trichome induction following damage. In a result that is consistent with a central prediction of optimal defense theory, the high allele at this location was from the ancestral population with low constitutive trichome production. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.},

Surface sediment samples were collected in October and December of 2010 and in April and July of 2011 along 40-70-m transects from the high tide to the intertidal zone including Spartina alterniflora-vegetated marsh, seagrass (Ruppia maritima)-dominated sediments, and nonvegetated sediments. Alkane and total hydrocarbon degraders in the sediment were detected, while PAH degraders were below detection limit at all locations examined during the sampling periods. The highest counts for microbial alkane degraders were observed at the high tide line in April and averaged to 8.65×10 5 of cells/g dry weight (dw) sediment. The abundance of alkane degraders during other months ranged from 9.49×10 3 to 3.87×10 4, while for total hydrocarbon degraders, it ranged between 5.62×10 3 and 1.14×10 5 of cells/g dw sediment. Pore water nutrient concentrations (NH 4 +, NO 3 -, NO 2 -, and PO 4 3-) showed seasonal changes with minimum values observed in December and April and maximum values in October and July. Concentrations of total petroleum hydrocarbons in sediments averaged 100.4±52.4 and 141.9±57.5 mg/kg in January and July, 2011, respectively. The presence of aerobic microbial communities during all seasons in these nearshore ecosystems suggests that an active and resident microbial community is capable of mineralizing a fraction of petroleum hydrocarbons. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.},

In 1995, we reported the first complete cellular genome sequences (Haemophilus influenza, 1815 genes, and Myco-plasma genitalium, 525 genes). Comparison of these sequences revealed a conserved core of about 250 essential genes, much smaller than either genome. In 1999, we introduced the meth-od of global transposon mutagenesis and ex-perimentally demonstrated that M. genitalium contains many genes that are nonessential for growth in the laboratory, even though it has the smallest genome known for an autonomously replicating cell found in nature. This implied that it should be possible to produce a minimal cell that is simpler than any natural one. Whole genomes can now be built from chemically syn-thesized oligonucleotides and brought to life by installation into a receptive cellular environ-ment. We have applied whole-genome design and synthesis to the problem of minimizing a cellular genome.}

The interactions between both partners can be manipulated by introducing novel catabolic/metabolic genes into host plant or endophytic bacteria genomes. The potential of the engineered organisms to degrade or accumulate contaminants is much wider than their wild relatives. Scope This review covers the recent developments for engineering catabolic/metabolic genes from a wide range of sources into plants or endophytic bacteria for the development of modified plant-endophyte interactions. Genetic alteration of plants promises enhanced catabolism by plant’s own enzymatic machinery or greater contaminant uptake/accumulation for subsequent in planta detoxification by complementary endophytes. On the other hand, bacteria may also be engineered to enhance the potential for degradation or alteration of catabolic pathways, either to protect the host plant against phytotoxicity or to improve the overall efficiency of phytoremediation in planta, a situation especially suitable when hydrophilic compounds fail to be degraded by rhizospheric microbes due to the rapid uptake by plants. This is followed by discussion on kinetic parameters controlling phytoremediation. Conclusions It is hypothesized that transgenic approach can result in synergistic and effective plant-endophyte partnerships for wider-range and enhanced capabilities of degrading and/or detoxifying contaminants.},

We compared this data to other samples taken from the other known mangrove data, a tropical rainforest, and ocean sediment. An examination of the microbial communities from a large mangrove forest that stretches across southwestern India showed strong similarities across the higher taxonomic levels. When ocean sediment and a single isolate from a tropical rain forest were included in the analysis, a strong pattern emerged with Bacteria from the phylum Proteobacteria being the prominent taxon among the forest samples. The ocean samples were predominantly Archaea, with Euryarchaeota as the dominant phylum. Principal component and functional analyses grouped the samples isolated from forests, including those from disparate mangrove forests and the tropical rain forest, from the ocean. Our findings show similar patterns in samples were isolated from forests, and these were distinct from the ocean sediment isolates. The taxonomic structure was maintained to the level of class, and functional analysis of the genes present also displayed these similarities.

Some innovative steps should be taken on an emergency basis to prepare plants for such unfriendly stressful conditions. Use of endophytic fungi might be one of the successful weapons to protect food crops, susceptible to high temperature. These endophytes are known to secrete vital stress responsive secondary metabolites that not only provide resistance to crops against abiotic stresses but also help in promoting plants-growth and yield. Therefore, endophytic fungi were isolated from the leaves and roots of Adiantum capillus-veneris L. and their potential were checked for secreting bioactive secondary metabolites and possessing plant-growth promoting potential. A high concentration of phenolics, flavonoids, salicylic acid (SA) and indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) were found in the culture filtrate of isolate AdR-1, thus confirming their growth promoting potential for plants. Later on, phylogenetic exploration and 18S rDNA sequence homology showed that the selected isolatic fungus is Rhizopus oryzae. This strain was inoculated to sunflower and soybean seedlings exposed to normal (25°C) and high (40°C) temperature stress in a growth chamber and their potential for thermal stress resistance was compared with control seedlings. Inoculated sunflower and soybean plants had shown low level of abscisic acid (ABA) while, high levels of ascorbic acid oxidase (AAO), catalase (CAT), proline, phenolics, flavonoids, sugars, proteins and lipids were noted. The endophytic fungus was also found stimulatory to chlorophyll content, shoot and root lengths, fresh and dry biomass as compared to un-inoculated plants. These results confirmed the beneficial role of R. oryzae for crop plants under thermal stress and suggested their use for sustainable agriculture in the future.},

Bacterial endophyte abundance and species richness were greater in the wastewater-treatment compared to untreated wetlands, but diversity metrics suggested this was due to incomplete sampling at some sites. Community composition of endophytes in the treated wetland differed from some but not all of the communities observed in untreated wetlands. Since baldcypress is a key restoration species for declining swamps in the southeastern US, our descriptive work provides a foundation for future studies to understand the functional roles of plant-microbial interactions and community patterns.},

We apply the four postulates to an important class of pulse events, biomass‐altering disturbances, and derive seven generalizations that predict disturbance magnitude, resource trajectory, rate of resource change, disturbance probability, biotic trait diversification at evolutionary scales, biotic diversity at ecological scales, and functional resilience. Ultimately, theory must define the variable combinations that result in dynamic stability, comprising resistance, recovery, and adaptation.},

As many species are unlikely to migrate fast enough to track the rapidly changing climate of the future, adaptation must play an increasingly important role in their response. In this paper we review recent work that has documented climate-related genetic diversity within populations or on the microgeographical scale. We then describe studies that have looked at the potential evolutionary responses of plant populations to future climate change. We argue that in fragmented landscapes, rapid climate change has the potential to overwhelm the capacity for adaptation in many plant populations and dramatically alter their genetic composition. The consequences are likely to include unpredictable changes in the presence and abundance of species within communities and a reduction in their ability to resist and recover from further environmental perturbations, such as pest and disease outbreaks and extreme climatic events. Overall, a range-wide increase in extinction risk is likely to result. We call for further research into understanding the causes and consequences of the maintenance and loss of climate-related genetic diversity within populations. ©2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

Despite the progress made in environmental microbiology techniques and knowledge, the succession and functional changes of the microbial community under multiple stressors are still poorly understood. This is a substantial knowledge gap as microbial communities regulate the biogeochemistry of stream ecosystems. Our study assessed the structural and temporal changes in stream fungal and bacterial communities associated with decomposing leaf litter under a multiple-stressor scenario. We conducted a fully crossed 4-factor experiment in 64 flow-through mesocosms fed by a pristine montane stream (21 days of colonisation, 21 days of manipulations) and investigated the effects of nutrient enrichment, flow velocity reduction and sedimentation after 2 and 3 weeks of stressor exposure. We used high-throughput sequencing and metabarcoding techniques (16S and 18S rRNA genes) to identify changes in microbial community composition. Our results indicate that (1) shifts in relative abundances of the pre-existing terrestrial microbial community, rather than changes in community identity, drove the observed responses to stressors; (2) changes in relative abundances within the microbial community paralleled decomposition rate patterns with time; (3) both fungal and bacterial communities had a certain resistance to stressors, as indicated by relatively minor changes in alpha diversity or multivariate community structure; (4) overall, stressor interactions were more common than stressor main effects when affecting microbial diversity metrics or abundant individual genera; and (5) stressor effects on microbes often changed from 2 weeks to 3 weeks of stressor exposure, with several response patterns being reversed. Our study suggests that future research should focus more on understanding the temporal dynamics of fungal and bacterial communities and how they relate to ecosystem processes to advance our understanding of the mechanisms associated with multiple-stressor interactions.},

Endophytes are fungal and bacterial symbionts of plants that can affect performance. As in more widely known symbioses, acute or chronic stressor exposure might trigger disassociation of endophytes from host plants. We tested this hypothesis by examining the effects of oil exposure following the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill on endophyte diversity and abundance in Spartina alterniflora - the foundational plant in northern Gulf coast salt marshes affected by the spill. We compared bacterial and fungal endophytes isolated from plants in reference areas to isolates from plants collected in areas with residual oil that has persisted for more than three years after the DWH spill. DNA sequence-based estimates showed that oil exposure shifted endophyte diversity and community structure. Plants from oiled areas exhibited near total loss of leaf fungal endophytes. Root fungal endophytes exhibited a more modest decline and little change was observed in endophytic bacterial diversity or abundance, though a shift towards hydrocarbon metabolizers was found in plants from oiled sites. These results show that plant-endophyte symbioses can be disrupted by stressor exposure, and indicate that symbiont community disassembly in marsh plants is an enduring outcome of the DWH spill.}

This loss and degradation threatens ecosystem functions and the services they provide. This paper summarizes ecological relationships controlled by hydrological processes in coastal wetland forests of the Mississippi River delta and presents two case studies that illustrate the complexity of assessing hydrological control on swamp forest establishment and growth. Productivity of overstory trees has been affected by these changes, but the first case study illustrates that the relationship between flooding and growth may be site-specific. An important effect of increased flooding has been to reduce regeneration of swamp forest trees. The second case study is an outline of the kind of hydrological analysis required to assess probability of regeneration success. 383}

  abstract = {The aerial surface of plants, known as the phyllosphere, represents a widespread and diverse habitat for microbes, but the fungal communities colonizing the surface of leaves are not well characterized, and how these communities are assembled on hosts is unknown. We used high-throughput sequencing of fungal communities on the leaves of 51 tree species in a lowland tropical rainforest in Panama to examine the influence of host plant taxonomy and traits on the fungi colonizing the phyllosphere. Fungal communities on leaves were dominated by the phyla Ascomycota (79\% of all sequences), Basidiomycota (11\%) and Chytridiomycota (5\%). Host plant taxonomic identity explained more than half of the variation in fungal community composition across trees, and numerous host functional traits related to leaf morphology, leaf chemistry, and plant growth and mortality were significantly associated with fungal community structure. Differences in fungal biodiversity among hosts suggest that individual tree species support unique fungal communities, and that diverse tropical forests also support a large number of fungal species. Similarities between phyllosphere and decomposer communities suggest that fungi inhabiting living leaves may have significant roles in ecosystem functioning in tropical forests.},

  abstract = {The phyllosphere—the aerial surfaces of plants, including leaves— is a ubiquitous global habitat that harbors diverse bacterial com-munities. Phyllosphere bacterial communities have the potential to influence plant biogeography and ecosystem function through their influence on the fitness and function of their hosts, but the host attributes that drive community assembly in the phyllosphere are poorly understood. In this study we used high-throughput sequencing to quantify bacterial community structure on the leaves of 57 tree species in a neotropical forest in Panama. We tested for relationships between bacterial communities on tree leaves and the functional traits, taxonomy, and phylogeny of their plant hosts. Bacterial communities on tropical tree leaves were diverse; leaves from individual trees were host to more than 400 bacterial taxa. Bacterial communities in the phyllosphere were dominated by a core microbiome of taxa including Actinobacteria, Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria, and Sphingobacteria. Host attributes including plant taxonomic identity, phylogeny, growth and mortality rates, wood density, leaf mass per area, and leaf nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations were corre-lated with bacterial community structure on leaves. The relative abundances of several bacterial taxa were correlated with suites of host plant traits related to major axes of plant trait variation, including the leaf economics spectrum and the wood density– growth/mortality tradeoff. These correlations between phyllo-sphere bacterial diversity and host growth, mortality, and func-tion suggest that incorporating information on plant–microbe associations will improve our ability to understand plant func-tional biogeography and the drivers of variation in plant and ecosystem function. tropical forests | host–microbe associations | plant microbiome | microbial ecology}

In addition to their application in agriculture, a promising field to exploit plant-bacteria partnerships is the remediation of soil and water polluted with hydrocarbons. Application of effective plant-bacteria partnerships for the remediation of hydrocarbons depend mainly on the presence and metabolic activities of plant associated rhizo- and endophytic bacteria possessing specific genes required for the degradation of hydrocarbon pollutants. Plants and their associated bacteria interact with each other whereby plant supplies the bacteria with a special carbon source that stimulates the bacteria to degrade organic contaminants in the soil. In return, plant associated-bacteria can support their host plant to overcome contaminated-induced stress responses, and improve plant growth and development. In addition, plants further get benefits from their associated-bacteria possessing hydrocarbon-degradation potential, leading to enhanced hydrocarbon mineralization and lowering of both phytotoxicity and evapotranspiration of volatile hydrocarbons. A better understanding of plant-bacteria partnerships could be exploited to enhance the remediation of hydrocarbon contaminated soils in conjunction with sustainable production of non-food crops for biomass and biofuel production. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The current study was aimed to investigate whether particular PGPR strain is responsible either for the decreased uptake of B together with salt toxic ions or to promote rice growth through an efficient antioxidative system under combined stresses of salinity and high B. Rice seedlings were maintained in pots according to completely randomized design (CRD) and stressed with high B (0.92 mmol L-1 or 10ppm) and NaCl (150 mmol L-1 or ECw of 14.7 d Sm-1) for 8 weeks. Half of the pots received Bacillus pumilus-inoculated rice seedlings, whereas the other half received un-inoculated ones. Subsequently, plants were harvested and analyzed for mineral composition and antioxidation activity either using atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS) or spectrophotometer. In the absence of PGPR, NaCl salinity significantly enhanced the leaf B and salt toxic ions concentrations, thereby resulting in the shoot growth reduction when compared with the control. Similarly, combined treatment increased the leaf and xylem sap B as compared to NaCl alone, however, remained insignificant for salt toxic ions. Contrary, NaCl+high B decreased the leaf B concentrations as compared to high B alone. Application of PGPR enhanced the plant growth under individual stresses due to enhanced activity of certain of antioxidative enzymes. In combined treatment, B. pumilus showed a positive potential for limiting the Na+ accumulation in rice leaves, but not for leaf B. Moreover, limited uptake of Na+ resulted in the decreased plant antioxidation activity irrespective of increasing leaf B concentrations which in turn enhanced the rice tolerance.},

Two indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) producing fungal strains, RSF-4L and RSF-6L, isolated from the leaves of S. nigrum, were initially screened for Cd tolerance and accumulation potential. In terms of dry biomass production, the strain RSF-6L showed higher tolerance and accumulation capacity for Cd toxicity in comparison to RSF-4L. Therefore, RSF-6L was applied in vivo to S. nigrum and grown for six weeks under Cd concentrations of 0, 10, and 30~mg~Kg−1 of dry sand. The effect of fungal inoculation assessed by plant physiological responses, endogenous biochemical regulations, and Cd profile in different tissues. Significant increase were observed in plant growth attributes such as shoot length, root length, dry biomass, leaf area, and chlorophyll contents in inoculated RSF-6L plants in comparison to non-inoculated plants with or without Cd contamination. RSF-6L inoculation decreased uptake of Cd in roots and above ground parts, as evidenced by a low bio-concentration factor (BCF) and improved tolerance index (TI). However, Cd concentration in the leaves remained the same for inoculated and non-inoculated plants under Cd spiking. Fungal inoculation protected the host plants, as evidenced by low peroxidase (POD) and polyphenol peroxidase (PPO) activities and high catalase (CAT) activity. Application of appropriate fungal inoculation that can improve tolerance mechanisms of hyper-accumulators and reduce Cd uptake can be recommended for phyto-stabilisation/immobilisation of heavy metals in crop fields.},

In this study, we characterize the culturable fungal and bacterial endophytes in the roots and leaves of baldcypress trees at four sites with varying levels of salinity and flooding regimes in southeastern Louisiana. Both salinity and flooding (water level) contributed to endophytic community composition of leaves and roots. We found that diversity and endophyte isolation frequency were higher in roots than in leaves, with leaf bacteria being almost negligible. Our study demonstrates a connection between environmental variables, plant symbionts, and a key restoration species.

  abstract = {Background and AimsLeaf life span is widely recognized as a key life history trait associated with herbivory resistance, but rigorous comparative data are rare for seedlings. The goal of this study was to examine how light environment affects leaf life span, and how ontogenetic development during the first year may influence leaf fracture toughness, lamina density and stem density that are relevant for herbivory resistance, leaf life span and seedling survival.MethodsData from three experiments encompassing 104 neotropical woody species were combined. Leaf life span, lamina and vein fracture toughness, leaf and stem tissue density and seedling survival were quantified for the first-year seedlings at standardized ontogenetic stages in shade houses and common gardens established in gaps and shaded understorey in a moist tropical forest in Panama. Mortality of naturally recruited seedlings till 1 year later was quantified in 800 1-m2 plots from 1994 to 2011.Key ResultsMedian leaf life span ranged widely among species, always greater in shade (ranging from 151 to {$>$}1790 d in the understorey and shade houses) than in gaps (115-867 d), but with strong correlation between gaps and shade. Leaf and stem tissue density increased with seedling age, whereas leaf fracture toughness showed only a weak increase. All these traits were positively correlated with leaf life span. Leaf life span and stem density were negatively correlated with seedling mortality in shade, while gap mortality showed no correlation with these traits.ConclusionsThe wide spectrum of leaf life span and associated functional traits reflects variation in shade tolerance of first-year seedlings among coexisting trees, shrubs and lianas in this neotropical forest. High leaf tissue density is important in enhancing leaf toughness, a known physical defence, and leaf life span. Both seedling leaf life span and stem density should be considered as key functional traits that contribute to seedling survival in tropical forest understoreys. © The Author 2013.},

Their functions vary tremendously so the structures of their communities influence plant and ecosystem functions. We determined the separate effects of neutral and deterministic processes structuring communities of Quercus gambelii leaf endo-phytes by sampling north-and south-facing flanks of four canyons so local climate varied independently from spatial separation. We found that both deterministic (response to climate) and neutral (dispersal limitation) processes significantly influenced community structure. These findings, if applicable to other systems, may have consequences in both agricultural and natural ecosystems. Endophyte dispersal could limit agricultural production, ecosystem restoration or natural plant establishment. Thus deliberate inoculation may prove useful in some situations. Moreover, the influence of climate on fungal endophyte communities indicates that climate change may not only impact plant distributions directly, but may also do so indirectly via the effect of endophytes on plant tolerance to temperature and moisture extremes.},

In this study, sediment oxygenation was assessed in situ in rhizospheres of the intertidal salt marsh grass, Spartina anglica - an invading species, vigorously spreading in many wetlands around the world. The rhizospheres of two populations of S. anglica with differing plant morphology growing in different sediment types were investigated in situ using a novel multifiber optode system with 100 oxygen probes. No oxygen was detected inside the rhizospheres at any depth in either location, indicating a limited impact of plant-mediated sediment oxygenation on the bulk anoxic sediment. Subsequent planar optode studies imaging the oxygen content around the roots substantiated these findings showing that sediment oxygenation was present in both locations, but it was confined only to the immediate vicinity of the root tips. The size of the oxic zones surrounding the root tips differed between sediment-types: in S. anglica growing in permeable sandy sediment, oxic root zones extended 1.5 mm away from the roots surface compared to only 0.4 mm in muddy tidal flat deposit, which had a substantially higher oxygen demand. The oxygen concentration inside the oxic root zones remained stable during continuous light and air-exposure of the aboveground biomass. In comparison, sediment oxygenation generated by burrowing infauna (Hediste diversicolor) showed to be markedly more temporally variability, reaching anoxic conditions multiple times during a 5-h period.},

  abstract = {Leaf-cutting ants (LCAs) are polyphagous, yet highly selective herbivores. The factors that govern their selection of food plants, however, remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that the induction of anti-herbivore defences by attacked food plants, which are toxic to either ants or their mutualistic fungus, should significantly affect the ants' foraging behaviour. To test this "induced defence hypothesis," we used lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus), a plant that emits many volatile organic compounds (VOCs) upon herbivore attack with known anti-fungal or ant-repellent effects. Our results provide three important insights into the foraging ecology of LCAs. First, leaf-cutting by Atta ants can induce plant defences: Lima bean plants that were repeatedly exposed to foraging workers of Atta colombica over a period of three days emitted significantly more VOCs than undamaged control plants. Second, the level to which a plant has induced its anti-herbivore defences can affect the LCAs' foraging behaviour: In dual choice bioassays, foragers discriminated control plants from plants that have been damaged mechanically or by LCAs 24 h ago. In contrast, strong induction levels of plants after treatment with the plant hormone jasmonic acid or three days of LCA feeding strongly repelled LCA foragers relative to undamaged control plants. Third, the LCA-specific mode of damaging leaves allows them to remove larger quantities of leaf material before being recognized by the plant: While leaf loss of approximately 15\{\%\} due to a chewing herbivore (coccinelid beetle) was sufficient to significantly increase VOC emission levels after 24 h, the removal of even 20\{\%\} of a plant's leaf area within 20 min by LCAs did not affect its VOC emission rate after 24 h. Taken together, our results support the "induced defence hypothesis" and provide first empirical evidence that the foraging behaviour of LCAs is affected by the induction of plant defence responses.}

The soils of the Great Nicobar mangroves were silt-clays and were poor in phosphate content. Five species of AMF belonging to the genus Glomus were isolated. The \%AMF colonization in the mangrove plants was between 0 and 17\%, and the presence of AMF in the aerenchymatous cortex suggests that the mangrove plants may be aiding in AMF survival by providing oxygen. Two strains of phosphate solubilising Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found in the mangrove soils of Great Nicobar. Phosphate solubilisation by the two isolated strains was almost 70\% under in vitro conditions. PSB may play a role in the mangrove ecosystems of Great Nicobar by mobilising insoluble phosphate.

  abstract = {© 2017 Kralik and Ricchi. Real time PCR (quantitative PCR, qPCR) is now a well-established method for the detection, quantification, and typing of different microbial agents in the areas of clinical and veterinary diagnostics and food safety. Although the concept of PCR is relatively simple, there are specific issues in qPCR that developers and users of this technology must bear in mind. These include the use of correct terminology and definitions, understanding of the principle of PCR, difficulties with interpretation and presentation of data, the limitations of qPCR in different areas of microbial diagnostics and parameters important for the description of qPCR performance. It is not our intention in this review to describe every single aspect of qPCR design, optimization, and validation; however, it is our hope that this basic guide will help to orient beginners and users of qPCR in the use of this powerful technique.},

We inventoried basal area and tree height, and monitored incremental growth (in basal area) of codominant baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) trees monthly, for over four years, to examine the inter-relationships among growth, site fertility, and soil physico-chemical characteristics. We found that salinity, soil total nitrogen (TN), flood duration, and flood frequency affected forest structure and growth the greatest. While mean annual site salinity ranged from 0.1 to 3.4 ppt, sites with salinity concentrations of 1.3 ppt or greater supported a basal area of less than 40 m 2 /ha. Where salinity was , 0.7 ppt, basal area was as high as 87 m 2 /ha. Stand height was also negatively affected by higher salinity. However, salinity related only to soil TN concentrations or to the relative balance between soil TN and total phosphorus (TP), which reached a maximum concentration between 1.2 and 2.0 ppt salinity. As estuarine influence shifts inland with sea-level rise, forest growth may become more strongly linked to salinity, not only due to salt effects but also as a consequence of site nitrogen imbalance.},

Recent restoration efforts have focused on the identification, and subsequent planting, of moderately salt-tolerant plant material within these "ghost forests." The long-term persistence of cypress swamps in these areas, however, will ultimately depend on the germination of seeds from the improved parent trees. This study investigates the germination capacity of seeds collected from baldcypress parent trees, located in both freshwater and brackish water environments. Seeds were tested at four different salinity levels under controlled conditions for a period of 65 days. Mean germination under the 0, 2, 4, and 6 g l(-1) seawater treatments was 26.3, 22.9, 15.4, and 10.2\%, respectively. Although none of the eight families used in this study had a germination greater than 50\%, three families demonstrated superiority in their germination capacity under all four salinity treatments. In general, brackish water seed sources had greater germination success than the two families from freshwater sources. Results indicate that families previously identified as moderately salt-tolerant based on physiological and morphological parameters may be equally successful in seed germination capacity under moderately saline conditions.},

Salinity level produced significant effects across all baldcypress half-sib families, with root elongation averaging 1594.0, 956.8, and 382.1 mm, respectively, for the 0, 4, and 6 g l-1 treatments. Combined mean root elongation for families from brackish-water seed sources was greater (1236.7 mm) than for families from freshwater seed sources (794.6 mm). Considerable variation occurred at the highest salinity treatment, however, with one freshwater family maintaining more than 28\% more root growth than the average of the two brackish-water collections. Hence, results indicate that short-term evaluation of root elongation at these salinity concentrations may not be a reliable method for salt tolerance screening of baldcypress. Species-level effects for height and diameter, which were measured at day 62, were significant for both parameters. Height increment in the control (7.4 cm), for example, was approximately five times greater than height increment in the 6 g l-1 salinity treatment (1.5 cm). Family-level variation was significant only for diameter, which had an incremental range of 0.2 to 1.5 mm across all salinity levels.},

Growth and nutrition of baldcypress families planted under varying salinity regimes in Louisiana, USA. Journal of Coastal Re-search, 16(1), 153-163. Royal Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Saltwater intrusion from the Gulf of Mexico is one important factor in the destruction of baldcypress (Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich.) swamps along the Louisiana Gulf Coast, USA. Recent restoration efforts have focused on iden-tification of baldcypress genotypes with greater tolerance to saline conditions than previously reported. To date, salt tolerance investigations have not been conducted under saline field conditions. In 1996, therefore, three plantations were established with 10 half-sib genotype collections of baldcypress in mesohaline wetlands. Tree survival and growth were measured at the end of two growing seasons, and foliar ion concentrations of Na, C1, K, and Ca and available soil nutrients were measured during the 1996 growing season. In general, soil nutrient concentrations exceeded av-erages found in other baldcypress stands in the southeastern United States. Seedlings differed among sites in all parameters measured, with height, diameter, foliar biomass, and survival decreasing as site salinity increased. Av-erage seedling height at the end of two years, for example, was 196.4 cm on the lowest salinity site and 121.6 cm on the highest. Several half-sib families maintained greater height growth increments (ranging from 25.5 to 54.5 cm on the highest salinity site), as well as lower foliar ion concentrations of K, Cl, and Ca. Results indicate that genotypic screening of baldcypress may improve growth and vigor of seedlings planted within wetlands impacted by saltwater intrusion.

  abstract = {Mangroves have a global distribution within coastal tropical and subtropical climates, and have even expanded to some temperate locales. Where they do occur, mangroves provide a plethora of goods and services, ranging from coastal protection from storms and erosion to direct income for human societies. The mangrove literature has become rather voluminous, prompting many subdisciplines within a field that earlier in the 20th century received little focus. Much of this research has become diffuse by sheer numbers, requiring detailed syntheses to make research results widely available to resource managers. In this review, we take an inclusive approach in focusing on eco-physiological and growth constraints to the establishment and early development of mangrove seedlings in the intertidal zone. This is a critical life stage for mangroves, i.e., the period between dispersal and recruitment to the sapling stage. We begin with some of the research that has set the precedent for seedling-level eco-physiological research in mangroves, and then we focus on recent advances (circa. 1995 to present) in our understanding of temperature, carbon dioxide, salinity, light, nutrient, flooding, and specific biotic influences on seedling survival and growth. As such, we take a new approach in describing seedling response to global factors (e.g., temperature) along with site-specific factors (e.g., salinity). All variables will strongly influence the future of seedling dynamics in ways perhaps not yet documented in mature forests. Furthermore, understanding how different mangrove species can respond to global factors and regional influences is useful for diagnosing observed mortality within mangrove wetlands, managed or natural. This review provides an updated eco-physiological knowledge base for future research and reforestation activity, and for understanding important links among climate change, local physico-chemical condition, and establishment and early growth of mangrove seedlings. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Soil CO2 emissions can dominate gaseous carbon losses from forested wetlands (swamps), especially those positioned in coastal environments. Understanding the varied roles of hydroperiod, salinity, temperature, and root productivity on soil respiration is important in discerning how carbon balances may shift as freshwater swamps retreat inland with sea-level rise and salinity incursion, and convert to mixed communities with marsh plants. We exposed soil mesocosms to combinations of permanent flooding, tide, and salinity, and tracked soil respiration over 2A1/2 growing seasons. We also related these measurements to rates from field sites along the lower Savannah River, Georgia, USA. Soil temperature and root productivity were assessed simultaneously for both experiments. Soil respiration from mesocosms (22.7-1678.2 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1)) differed significantly among treatments during four of the seven sampling intervals, where permanently flooded treatments contributed to low rates of soil respiration and tidally flooded treatments sometimes contributed to higher rates. Permanent flooding reduced the overall capacity for soil respiration as soils warmed. Salinity did reduce soil respiration at times in tidal treatments, indicating that salinity may affect the amount of CO2 respired with tide more strongly than under permanent flooding. However, soil respiration related greatest to root biomass (mesocosm) and standing root length (field); any stress reducing root productivity (incl. salinity and permanent flooding) therefore reduces soil respiration. Overall, we hypothesized a stronger, direct role for salinity on soil respiration, and found that salinity effects were being masked by varied capacities for increases in respiration with soil warming as dictated by hydrology, and the indirect influence that salinity can have on plant productivity.},

  abstract = {Salinity affects growth and development of plants, but mangroves exhibit exceptional salt tolerance. With direct exposure to salinity, mangrove roots possess specific adaptations to tolerate salt stress. Therefore, studying the early effects of salt on mangrove roots can help us better understand the tolerance mechanisms. Using two-month-old greenhouse-grown seedlings of the mangrove tree Avicennia officinalis subjected to NaCl treatment, we profiled gene expression changes in the roots by RNA-sequencing. Of the 6547 genes that were differentially regulated in response to salt treatment, 1404 and 5213 genes were significantly up- and down-regulated, respectively. By comparative genomics, 93 key salt tolerance-related genes were identified of which 47 were up-regulated. Upon placing all the differentially expressed genes (DEG) in known signaling pathways, it was evident that most of the DEGs involved in ethylene and auxin signaling were up-regulated while those involved in ABA signaling were down-regulated. These results imply that ABA-independent signaling pathways also play a major role in salt tolerance of A. officinalis. Further, ethylene response factors (ERFs) were abundantly expressed upon salt treatment and the Arabidopsis mutant aterf115, a homolog of AoERF114 is characterized. Overall, our results would help in understanding the possible molecular mechanism underlying salt tolerance in plants.}

Roots and rhizospheric soil samples were analysed for spore density, frequency of mycorrhizal colonization and some chemical characteristics of soil. Relative abundance, frequency and spore richness of AMF were assessed at each inundation type. All the plant species except Avicennia alba exhibited mycorrhizal colonization. The study demonstrated that mycorrhizal colonization and spore density were more influenced by host plant species than tidal inundation. Forty four AMF species belonging to six genera, namely Acaulospora, Entrophospora, Gigaspora, Glomus, Sclerocystis and Scutellospora, were recorded. Glomus mosseae exhibited highest frequency at all the inundation types; Glomus fistulosum, Sclerocystis coremioides and Glomus mosseae showed highest relative abundance at sites inundated by usual springtides, summer springtides and diurnal tides, respectively. Spore richness of AMF was of the order usual springtide {$>$} diurnal {$>$} summer springtide inundated sites. The mean spore richness was 3.27. Diurnally inundated sites had the lowest concentrations of salinity, available phosphorus, exchangeable potassium, sodium and magnesium. Statistical analyses indicated that mycorrhizal frequency and AMF spore richness were significantly negatively correlated to soil salinity. Spore richness was also significantly negatively correlated to available phosphorus. The soil parameters of the usual springtide inundated sites appeared to be favourable for the existence of maximum number of AMF. Glomus mosseae was the predominant species in terms of frequency in the soils of the Sundarbans. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract = {The mycorrhizal symbiosis between soil fungi and plant roots is a ubiquitous mutualism that plays key roles in plant nutrition, soil health, and carbon cycling. The symbiosis evolved repeatedly and independently as multiple morphotypes [e.g., arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM), ectomycorrhizal (ECM)] in multiple fungal clades (e.g., phyla Glomeromycota, Ascomycota, Basidiomycota). The accessibility and cultivability of many mycorrhizal partners make them ideal models for symbiosis studies. Alongside molecular, physiological, and ecological investigations, sequencing led to the first three mycorrhizal fungal genomes, representing two morphotypes and three phyla. The genome of the ECM basidiomycete Laccaria bicolor showed that the mycorrhizal lifestyle can evolve through loss of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) and expansion of lineage-specific gene families such as short secreted protein (SSP) effectors. The genome of the ECM ascomycete Tuber melanosporum showed that the ECM type can evolve without expansion of families as in Laccaria, and thus a different set of symbiosis genes. The genome of the AM glomeromycete Rhizophagus irregularis showed that despite enormous phylogenetic distance and morphological difference from the other two fungi, symbiosis can involve similar solutions as symbiosis-induced SSPs and loss of PCWDEs. The three genomes provide a solid base for addressing fundamental questions about the nature and role of a vital mutualism.},

  abstract = {Coastal wetlands are commonly exposed to hydrocarbon pollutants derived from extraction disasters like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Naturally occurring microbes can degrade oil, but the rate of oil degradation depends heavily on the key chemical and biological factors. The goal of this study was to determine the influence of interactions between marsh plants and nitrogen (N) on the degradation of oil from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Oil disappearance was measured with gas chromatography (GC) focusing on the change in C 18 n-alkane-to-phytane ratio of oil, and instantaneous oil degradation rates were measured using an instantaneous carbon isotopic partitioning method. N addition often stimulates oil decomposition in soil slurries, but the effect of N in our mesocosms depended on plant species. N addition accelerated oil degradation in Spartina alterniflora mesocosms but slowed oil degradation in Spartina patens mesocosms. Across all plant and N treatments, oil degradation related to plant root growth. In many ecosystems including marshes, N addition has been shown to diminish root growth by reducing the need for nutrient foraging. Where N addition reduces root growth, N may ultimately exacerbate oxygen scarcity in marsh soils possibly negating or reversing the positive, direct effects that N has on oil degradation. Based on these findings, fertilization strategies that maximize marsh plant root growth will be the most effective at increasing the microbial degradation of oil and will have the greatest potential to mitigate the impacts of oil in marsh ecosystems.},

Periods of falling and low [CO               2               ] in the palaeo-record appear to have created selective pressure for important adaptations in modern plants. Today, rising [CO               2               ] is a key component of anthropogenic global environmental change that will impact plants and the ecosystem goods and services they deliver. Currently, there is limited evidence that natural plant populations have evolved in response to contemporary increases in [CO               2               ] in ways that increase plant productivity or fitness, and no evidence for incidental breeding of crop varieties to achieve greater yield enhancement from rising [CO               2               ]. Evolutionary responses to elevated [CO               2               ] have been studied by applying selection in controlled environments, quantitative genetics and trait-based approaches. Findings to date suggest that adaptive changes in plant traits in response to future [CO               2               ] will not be consistently observed across species or environments and will not be large in magnitude compared with physiological and ecological responses to future [CO               2               ]. This lack of evidence for strong evolutionary effects of elevated [CO               2               ] is surprising, given the large effects of elevated [CO               2               ] on plant phenotypes. New studies under more stressful, complex environmental conditions associated with climate change may revise this view. Efforts are underway to engineer plants to: (i) overcome the limitations to photosynthesis from today's [CO               2               ] and (ii) benefit maximally from future, greater [CO               2               ].

  abstract = {We present a new multivariate technique for testing the significance of individual terms in a multifactorial analysis-of-variance model for multispecies response variables. The technique will allow researchers to base analyses on measures of association (distance measures) that are ecologically relevant. In addition, unlike other distance-based hypothesis-testing techniques, this method allows tests of significance of interaction terms in a linear model. The technique uses the existing method of redundancy analysis (RDA) but allows the analysis to be based on Bray-Curtis or other ecologically meaningful measures through the use of principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Steps in the procedure include: (1) calculating a matrix of distances among replicates using a distance measure of choice (e.g., Bray-Curtis); (2) determining the principal coordinates (including a correction for negative eigenvalues, if necessary), which preserve these distances; (3) creating a matrix of dummy variables corresponding to the design of the experiment (i.e., individual terms in a linear model); (4) analyzing the relationship between the principal coordinates (species data) and the dummy variables (model) using RDA; and (5) implementing a test by permutation for particular statistics corresponding to the particular terms in the model. This method has certain advantages not shared by other multivariate testing procedures.

It is our view that distance-based RDA will be extremely useful to ecologists measuring multispecies responses to structured multifactorial experimental designs.},

  abstract = {Summary                            1.               Tests of significance of the individual canonical axes in redundancy analysis allow researchers to determine which of the axes represent variation that can be distinguished from random. Variation along the significant axes can be mapped, used to draw biplots or interpreted through subsequent analyses, whilst the nonsignificant axes may be dropped from further consideration.                                         2.               Three methods have been implemented in computer programs to test the significance of the canonical axes; they are compared in this paper. The simultaneous test of all individual canonical axes, which is appealing because of its simplicity, produced incorrect (highly inflated) levels of type I error for the axes following those corresponding to true relationships in the data, so it is invalid. The ‘marginal’ testing method implemented in the ‘vegan’ R package and the ‘forward’ testing method implemented in the program CANOCO were found to have correct levels of type I error and comparable power. Permutation of the residuals achieved greater power than permutation of the raw data.                                         3.

In addition, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters Fv/Fm and Fv/Fo were higher in the infected seedlings compared to the non-infected seedlings under Pb stress. Malondialdehyde accumulation was induced by Pb stress, and it was present in higher concentration in non-infected seedlings under higher concentrations of Pb (100 and 200 ??M). Antioxidant activity was either higher or unchanged in the infected seedlings due to responses to the different Pb concentrations. These results suggest that the endophytic fungus improved rice growth under moderate Pb levels by enhancing photosynthesis and antioxidant activity relative to non-infected rice. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The four tree species had similar overall colonisation rates of endophytic fungi (24–33\%). The colonisation rates of endophytic fungi were higher in twigs (30–58\%) than in leaves (6–25\%) in the four plant species. A total of 36 endophytic fungal taxa were identified based on morphological characteristics and molecular data, including 35 Ascomycota and 1 Basidiomycota, dominated by Phomopsis, Phyllosticta, Xylaria, Leptosphaerulina, and Pestalotiopsis.

By contrast, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have been reported to promote seedling performance; however, it is unknown whether this is also distance dependent. Here, we investigate the distance dependence of seedling performance in the presence of both pathogens and AMF. In a subtropical forest in south China, we conducted a four-year field census of four species with relatively large phylogenetic distances and found no distance-dependent mortality for newly germinated seedlings. By experimentally separating the effects of AMF and pathogens on seedling performance of six subtropical tree species in a shade house, we found that soil pathogens significantly inhibited seedling survival and growth while AMF largely promoted seedling growth, and these effects were host specific and declined with increasing conspecific distance. Together, our field and experimental results suggest that AMF can neutralize the negative effect of pathogens and that the Janzen-Connell effect may play a less prominent role in explaining diversity of nondominant tree species than previously thought.},

Seven months after the Macondo MC 252 oil made landfall along the shoreline salt marshes of northern Barataria Bay, Louisiana, concentrations of total petroleum hydrocarbons in the surface 2 cm of heavily oiled marsh soils were as high as 510 mg g −1 . Heavy oiling caused almost complete mortality of both species. However, moderate oiling impacted Spartina less severely than Juncus and, relative to the reference marshes, had no significant effect on Spartina while significantly lowering live aboveground biomass and stem density of Juncus. A greenhouse mesocosm study supported field results and indicated that S. alternif lora was much more tolerant to shoot oil coverage than J. roemerianus. Spartina recovered from as much as 100\% oil coverage of shoots in 7 months; however, Juncus recovered to a much lesser extent. Soil-oiling significantly affected both species. Severe impacts of the Macondo oil to coastal marsh vegetation most likely resulted from oil exposure of the shoots and oil contact on/in the marsh soil, as well as repeated oiling events.}

In the greenhouse, south Louisiana crude oil was applied to natural marsh sods at rates of 0, 4, 8, 16 and 24 l m-2. The photosynthetic rate of S. patens significantly decreased with increasing oil dosage after l month of oil application, while the photosynthetic rate of S. alterniflora was not significantly reduced by oil application until 3 months. The photosynthetic rate of S. lancifolia was not detrimentally affected by the oil treatments. Four months after oil application, live above-ground biomass production was significantly reduced at higher oil dosages for S. patens, was not affected in S. alterniflora, while S. lancifolia exhibited significantly higher total biomass at 24 l m-2 compared to the controls. The year following oil application, no regrowth of S. patens and S. alterniflora occurred at oil levels above 8 l m-2. In contrast, the regrowth of above-ground biomass of S. lancifolia increased with increasing oil dosage and resulted in communities at 16 and 24 l m-2. Furthermore, the residual oil in the soil greatly differed among the three marsh-types, with the highest concentrations in the S. patens soil sods and the lowest concentrations in S. alterniflora soil sods. This difference in oil residue among the marsh-types was mainly due to differences in soil organic content. The sensitivity of these marsh-types to south Louisiana crude oil increased in the following order: S. lancifolia, S. alterniflora and S. patens.}

Plants were killed at oil dosages of 8 1 m-2 in the growing season following oil application. Two years after application of the oil, S. alterniflora and S. patens individuals were transplanted into the oiled and unoiled sods. Fertilizer was applied 1 and 7 months after transplantation. Application of the fertilizer significantly increased biomass of the transplants within 6 months and regrowth biomass of the transplants 1 year after transplantation for both plant species. The residual oil in the soil did not significantly affect the biomass of the S. patens transplants compared with that in the no oil treatment, except at the highest oil level. However, regrowth biomass of the S. alterniflora transplants treated with fertilizer was significantly higher at all oil levels up to 250 mg g-1 than in the unoiled treatment, with or without fertilizer. The oil degradation rate in the soil was significantly enhanced by the application of fertilizer in conjunction with the presence of transplants. These results suggest that vegetative transplantation, when implemented with fertilization, can simultaneously restore oil contaminated wetlands and accelerate oil degradation in the soil.},

S. alterniflora were transplanted into soil with 10 dosage levels of No. 2 fuel oil ranging from 0 to 456 mgg-1 dry soil. Three months after transplantation, values for plant biomass, stem density, and shoot height decreased significantly with increasing fuel oil level in a dose-response fashion. Evapo-transpiration rates were correlated with the total biomass response. Relative to the control, a significant decrease in total (above- plus below-ground) plant biomass was observed at concentrations above 57 mgg-1 dry soil. Within the 3-month experimental period, detrimental effects on below-ground biomass accumulation and bioluminescence of the marine bacterium Viberio fisheri in the Microtox Solid Phase Test were observed at oil concentrations {$>$}29 mgg-1 dry soil, suggesting that biological effects of oil within the sediment matrix may be more pronounced than on above-ground biomass, requiring a dosage ≥228 mgg-1 dry soil to elicit a significant detrimental effect. Hence, measurements of oil effects with biological end-points based solely on above-ground responses may underestimate the potential impacts of petroleum hydrocarbon spills, especially when the oil has penetrated the soil. While S. alterniflora was proved to be relatively tolerant to the No. 2 fuel oil spills, its effectiveness in phytoremediation operations may be limited at fuel oil levels 228 mgg-1 dry soil, as both plant growth and microbial activity may be constrained. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Initially, heavy oiling resulted in near complete plant mortality, and subsequent recovery of live aboveground biomass was only 50\% of reference marshes 42 months after the spill. Heavy oiling also changed the vegetation structure of shoreline marshes from a mixed Spartina-Juncus community to predominantly Spartina; live Spartina aboveground biomass recovered within 2-3 years, however, Juncus showed no recovery. In addition, live belowground biomass (0-12 cm) in heavily oiled marshes was reduced by 76\% three and a half years after the spill. Detrimental effects of heavy oiling on marsh plants also corresponded with significantly lower soil shear strength, lower sedimentation rates, and higher vertical soil-surface erosion rates, thus potentially affecting shoreline salt marsh stability.},

We showed that FungiQuant's is 100\% sensitive and its amplification efficiencies ranged from 76.3\% to 114.5\%, with r(2)-values of {$>$}0.99 against the 69 fungal species tested. Additionally, FungiQuant inter- and intra-run coefficients of variance ranged from {$<$}10\% and {$<$}20\%, respectively. We further showed that FungiQuant has a limit of quantification 25 copies and a limit of detection at 5 copies. Lastly, by comparing results from human-only background DNA with low-level fungal DNA, we showed that amplification in two or three of a FungiQuant performed in triplicate is statistically significant for true positive fungal detection.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: FungiQuant has comprehensive coverage against diverse fungi and is a robust quantification and detection tool for delineating between true fungal detection and non-target human DNA.}

  abstract = {We investigated the impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on microbial communities in wetland sediment and seawater samples collected from sites along the Gulf shore. Based on GC/MS analysis, the sediment from Bay Jimmy, LA had detectable signs of hydrocarbon contamination, identified as n-alkanes in the GC/MS spectrum similar to that of the Deepwater Horizon source oil (MC-252). To identify changes in microbial assemblage structure and functional diversity in response to hydrocarbon contamination, five genes (bacterial 16S rRNA, Pseudomonas-specific 16S rRNA, alkB, P450, and PAH-RHD a) were selected based on the specific enzymes encoded by bacteria to degrade alkanes or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. A quantitative PCR analysis revealed the presence of alkane and PAH-degrading genes in both contaminated and non-contaminated samples with no significant difference in gene content between contaminated and non-contaminated samples. However, the ribotype analysis based on pyrosequencing identified 17 bacteria genera known for their capacity to degrade hydrocarbons, including Mycobacterium, Novosphingobium, Parvibaculum, Pseudomonas, and Sphingomonas, in the contaminated sediment sample. Furthermore, the contaminated sample had a very high relative abundance of 16S rRNA gene sequences affiliated with the genus Parvibaculum, members of which have been characterized for their degradative abilities. These data suggest that specific bacterial taxa within the genus Parvibaculum have the capacity for hydrocarbon degradation and could use the hydrocarbons as a carbon and energy source, resulting in a dominant population in a hydrocarbon-contaminated soil. In summary, when exposed to the spilled oil, the distinct wetland microbial communities responded with decreased diversity and increased abundance of selective degradative species. Environmental impact The catastrophic Deepwater Horizon oil spill occurred near the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The aermath includes ve-million barrels of leaked crude oil, a million liters of dispersant and a huge uncertainty regarding its ecological impact on the Gulf of Mexico. To understand the microbial population shis caused by the event and to mitigate the contamination accordingly, sediment samples near the Gulf of Mexico were examined. The microbial community analysis presented in this study provides detailed information on microbial populations. Emphasis was given to the putative alkane degraders, which will be a direct measure of the capability of bioremediation (or natural attenuation) by indigenous microorganisms. It was shown that the contaminated sediment had a selective growth of the alkane degrader, Parvibaculum taxa, with a low diversity of microbial species as compared to the non-contaminated samples. We anticipate that the result will be benecial for further mitigation of oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico.}

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {$<$}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

These microfossils are more than half a billion years older than previously reported unambiguous occurrences of fungi, a date which is consistent with data from molecular clocks for the emergence of this clade6,7.

  abstract = {Nutrient enrichment of the coastal zone places intense pressure on marine communities. Previous studies have shown that growth of intertidal mangrove forests is accelerated with enhanced nutrient availability. However, nutrient enrichment favours growth of shoots relative to roots, thus enhancing growth rates but increasing vulnerability to environmental stresses that adversely affect plant water relations. Two such stresses are high salinity and low humidity, both of which require greater investment in roots to meet the demands for water by the shoots. Here we present data from a global network of sites that documents enhanced mortality of mangroves with experimental nutrient enrichment at sites where high sediment salinity was coincident with low rainfall and low humidity. Thus the benefits of increased mangrove growth in response to coastal eutrophication is offset by the costs of decreased resilience due to mortality during drought, with mortality increasing with soil water salinity along climatic gradients.}

Most lichen fungi are thought to be associated with just four photobiont genera, among them the cyanobacteria Nostoc and Scytonema, two of the most important nitrogen fixers in humid ecosystems. Although many Nostoc photobionts have been identified using isolated cultures and sequences, the identity of Scytonema photobionts has never been confirmed by culturing or sequencing. We investigated the phylogenetic placement of presumed Scytonema photobionts and unicellular morphotypes previously assigned to Chroococcus, from tropical Dictyonema, Acantholichen, Coccocarpia, and Stereocaulon lichens. While we confirm that filamentous and unicellular photobiont morphotypes belong to a single clade, this clade does not cluster with Scytonema but represents a novel, previously unrecognized, highly diverse, exclusively lichenized lineage, for which the name Rhizonema is available. The phylogenetic structure observed in this novel lineage suggests absence of coevolution with associated mycobionts at the species or clade level. Instead, highly efficient photobiont strains appear to have evolved through photobiont sharing between unrelated, but ecologically similar, coexisting lineages of lichenized fungi ("lichen guilds"), via the selection of particular photobiont strains through and subsequent horizontal transfer among unrelated mycobionts, a phenomenon not unlike crop domestication.},

Indeed, in some cases, such as mycorrhizal fungi or other growth promoting endophytes, they can be beneficial for the plant. Here some examples are reviewed where the host plant and/or endophyte metabolism can be induced by the other partner. Also, partial or complete biosynthesis pathways for plant secondary metabolites can be attributed to such endophytes. In other cases the host plant is able to metabolize substances from fungal origin. The question of the natural role of such metabolic changes for the endophyte will be briefly touched.

Though it is well understood that environmental perturbations like oil pollution can alter the diversity and composition of microbiomes, remarkably little is known about how disturbance alters plant-fungal associations. Using Next-Generation sequencing of the 18S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) region, we examined outcomes of enduring oil exposure on aboveground leaf and belowground endophytic root and rhizosphere fungal communities of Spartina alterniflora, a highly valued ecosystem engineer in southeastern Louisiana marshes affected by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon accident. We found that aboveground foliar fungal communities exhibited site-dependent compositional turnover with consequent loss in diversity according to oiling history. Rhizosphere soil communities also exhibited shifts in community composition associated with oiling history, whereas root endophytic communities did not. Oiling did not increase or decrease similarities among aboveground and belowground communities within an individual host, indicating that host plant characteristics exert stronger control than external factors on fungal community composition. These results show that fungal community responses to oiling vary within tissues of the same host plant, and that differences in the local environment, or alternatively, site-specific differences in residual oil constrain the magnitude of exposure responses. Our study offers novel perspectives on how environmental contaminants and perturbations can influence plant microbiomes, highlighting the importance of assessing long-term ecological outcomes of oil pollution to better understand how shifts in microbial communities influence plant performance and ecosystem function. Our findings are relevant to coastal management programs tasked with responding to oil spills and increasing pressures arising from intensifying development and climate change. Understanding how modification of plant-microbiome associations influences plant performance, particularly of ecosystem engineers like S. alterniflora, can help guide efforts to protect and restore at-risk coastal ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Cultivation and environmental changes can induce development of novel phenotypes in plants. For example, the root morphology of cultivated purple root Eichhornia crassipes differs remarkably from normal Eichhornia crassipes and also shows an enhanced ability to absorb heavy metal from groundwater. However, the changes in gene expression associated with these processes are unknown because of the lack of information on its large and unsequenced genome and its complex plant-rhizosphere symbiotic system. To investigate these gene expression changes, we applied a new strategy, direct de novo metatranscriptome analysis. Using this approach, we assembled the metatranscriptome of the entire rhizosphere and identified species-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) via hyper-accurate algorithms, showing a polarized plant/fungus distribution: the plant genes were responsible for morphological changes to the root system, offering a greater volume and surface area that hosts more fungi; while genes associated with heavy metal response in the fungus Fusarium were upregulated more than 3600-fold. These results suggested a distinct and synergistic functional response by the plant and fungal transcriptomes, indicating significant plant/ fungal crosstalk during environmental changes. This study demonstrates that the metatranscriptomic approach adopted here offers a cost-efficient strategy to study symbiosis systems without the need for a priori genomic knowledge. Plants coevolved with a wide range of microorganisms in their environments and have formed many dif-ferent and complex patterns of symbiosis with some of these microorganisms 1 . One of the most impor-tant and widely studied of these is the rhizosphere symbiosis system, that is, the interaction of the plant root system with soil microorganisms 2–5 . In this symbiosis system, the plant root secretes substances that affect the behavior of microsymbionts; in turn, the microorganisms influence the physiology and metabolism of the root and can thus play an important role in the adaptation of plants to the environ-ment 6,7 . The rhizosphere symbiosis system is also of considerable interest because of its potential role in remediation of environmental pollution 5,8–10 . For example, symbiotic systems can enhance the degrada-tion of organic contamination, increase the rates of nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P) fixation, and help to sequester heavy metals in polluted water and soil 3–5,9–15 .

Here we evaluate the origins of plant-fungal symbioses and saprotrophy using a time-calibrated phylogenetic framework that reveals linked and drastic shifts in diversification rates of each kingdom. Fungal colonization of land was associated with at least two origins of terrestrial green algae and preceded embryophytes (as evidenced by losses of fungal flagellum, ca. 720\,Ma), likely facilitating terrestriality through endomycorrhizal and possibly endophytic symbioses. The largest radiation of fungi (Leotiomyceta), the origin of arbuscular mycorrhizae, and the diversification of extant embryophytes occurred ca. 480\,Ma. This was followed by the origin of extant lichens. Saprotrophic mushrooms diversified in the Late Paleozoic as forests of seed plants started to dominate the landscape. The subsequent diversification and explosive radiation of Agaricomycetes, and eventually of ectomycorrhizal mushrooms, were associated with the evolution of Pinaceae in the Mesozoic, and establishment of angiosperm-dominated biomes in the Cretaceous.},

In recent years, phytoremediation assisted by bacterial endophytes has been highly recommended for cleaning up of metal polluted soils since endophytic bacteria can alleviate metal toxicity in plant through their own metal resistance system and facilitate plant growth under metal stress. Endophytic bacteria improve plant growth in metal polluted soils in two different ways: 1) directly by producing plant growth beneficial substances including solubilization/transformation of mineral nutrients (phosphate, nitrogen and potassium), production of phytohormones, siderophores and specific enzymes; and 2) indirectly through controlling plant pathogens or by inducing a systemic resistance of plants against pathogens. Besides, they also alter metal accumulation capacity in plants by excreting metal immobilizing extracellular polymeric substances, as well as metal mobilizing organic acids and biosurfactants. The present work aims to review the progress of recent research on the isolation, identification and diversity of metal resistant endophytic bacteria and illustrate various mechanisms responsible for plant growth promotion and heavy metal detoxification/phytoaccumulation/translocation in plants.},

Some strains of Streptomyces are known to prevent RKN disease in plants, but little attention has been given to their biocontrol effects in crops such as tomato. In this study, pot experiments were conducted to assess the effects of a Streptomyces agent (1:1 mixture of S. pactum and S. Rochei) for biocontrol of RKN disease in tomato. We quantified endophytes in tomato roots, as well as microbes and nematodes in root zone soil with or without inoculation of Streptomyces. Additionally, we measured the plant biomass and physiobiochemical traits of tomato at different growth stages. The results showed that after inoculation of Streptomyces: (i) The RKN disease index of tomato plants decreased by 37\%. The quantity of bacterial-feeding nematodes decreased by 14\% in root zone soil, while the quantity of fungal-feeding and plant parasitic nematodes increased by 10\% and 137\%, respectively. (ii) The fresh weight of shoot and root increased by 14\% and 35\%, respectively. Meanwhile, the polyphenol oxidase activity of leaves increased by 33\% at the seedling stage. (iii) The total number of culturable bacteria decreased by 49\% in root knots. Regarding the total number of culturable microbes in root zone soil, bacteria and actinomycetes also decreased by 18\% and 10\%, respectively, whereas fungi increased by 20\%. Moreover, the quantity of both plant growth-promoting bacteria and nematicidal bacteria increased, while the quantity of plant-pathogenic bacteria decreased. In conclusion, the Streptomyces agent could reduce RKN disease in tomato by activating the systemic resistance and defensive mechanism against nematode infection. This agent triggered complex interactions between plants, microbes, and nematodes in the micro-ecosystem of root zone soil, resulting in decreased RKN infection ability and/or enhanced tomato disease resistance.},

Despite the ecological and economic importance of bats and birds in tropical forests, agroforestry systems, and agricultural systems mixed with natural forest, a systematic review of their impact is still missing. A growing number of bird and bat exclosure experiments has improved our knowledge allowing new conclusions regarding their roles in food webs and associated ecosystem services. Here, we review the distribution patterns of insectivorous birds and bats, their local and landscape drivers, and their effects on trophic cascades in tropical ecosystems. We report that for birds but not bats community composition and relative importance of functional groups changes conspicuously from forests to habitats including both agricultural areas and forests, here termed ?forest-agri? habitats, with reduced representation of insectivores in the latter. In contrast to previous theory regarding trophic cascade strength, we find that birds and bats reduce the density and biomass of arthropods in the tropics with effect sizes similar to those in temperate and boreal communities. The relative importance of birds versus bats in regulating pest abundances varies with season, geography and management. Birds and bats may even suppress tropical arthropod outbreaks, although positive effects on plant growth are not always reported. As both bats and birds are major agents of pest suppression, a better understanding of the local and landscape factors driving the variability of their impact is needed.},

Concentrations of alkanes and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at oil-impacted sites significantly decreased over this time period. Here, a combination of DNA, lipid, and isotopic approaches confirm that microbial biodegradation was contributing to the observed petroleum mass loss. Natural abundance (14)C analysis of microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) reveals that petroleum-derived carbon was a primary carbon source for microbial communities at impacted sites several months following oil intrusion when the highest concentrations of oil were present. Also at this time, microbial community analysis suggests that community structure of all three domains has shifted with the intrusion of oil.

While these techniques are advantageous, because they do not rely on the need to culture organisms, each technique may have its own biases and/or limitations when used to assess fungal diversity from mixed-template samples. In this study, we analyzed PCR specificity and efficiency of the ITS primers (ITS1F and ITS4) in a series of single- and mixed-template samples using a combined quantitative PCR-length heterogeneity analysis (LH-qPCR) approach. As expected, these primers successfully amplified all higher fungal species tested (10 ascomycetes, 6 basidiomycetes, and 4 zygomycetes) and no members of the oomycetes. Based on our results, and a search of the GenBank database, amplicons of the ITS1F and ITS4 primer set exhibit considerable variability (420 to 825~bp), but due to similarities in amplicon sizes of some fungal species, actual species diversity in environmental samples may be underestimated approximately two-fold. The addition of an initial qPCR step allowed for the accurate quantitation of total fungal DNA in mixed-template samples over five orders of magnitude (10- 1 to 103~pg μl- 1). PCR biases between individuals in mixed-templates rendered it impossible to determine the absolute quantity of any individual within a population from its individual peak height. However, relative changes in individuals within a mixed-template sample could be determined due to a constant proportionality between peak heights and starting template concentration. Variability associated with the individual steps of the LH-qPCR analysis was also determined from environmental samples. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We disagree. Pace contends that the term prokaryote refers to the lack of a nucleus and that it is hence a "negative and therefore scientifically invalid description" of cell organization, because "no one can define what is a prokaryote". The former is a matter of opinion, and the latter is arguably incorrect. Prokaryotes are cells with co-transcriptional translation on their main chromosomes; they translate nascent messenger RNAs into protein. The presence of this character distinguishes them from cells that possess a nucleus and do not translate nascent transcripts on their main chromosomes. Although historically founded on a negative trait (lacking a nucleus), the term prokaryote does indeed specifically designate organisms that are defined by a positive character. Pace proposes that we should speak only of archaea and bacteria instead of prokaryotes, and that if a collective term is needed to designate those cells that are not eukaryotes, the term 'microbe' should be used. That suggestion, too, is unacceptable, because many eukaryotes are microbes. Regardless of what any gene tree might suggest and regardless of what anyone might believe about early evolution, modern cells lacking spliceosomal introns and spliceosomes, a nucleus, and mitochondria do possess transcriptionally coupled translation — they are prokaryotes.}

  abstract = {The Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill in the spring of 2010 resulted in an input of B4.1 million barrels of oil to the Gulf of Mexico; 422\% of this oil is unaccounted for, with unknown environmental consequences. Here we investigated the impact of oil deposition on microbial communities in surface sediments collected at 64 sites by targeted sequencing of 16S rRNA genes, shotgun metagenomic sequencing of 14 of these samples and mineralization experiments using 14 C-labeled model substrates. The 16S rRNA gene data indicated that the most heavily oil-impacted sediments were enriched in an uncultured Gammaproteobacterium and a Colwellia species, both of which were highly similar to sequences in the DWH deep-sea hydrocarbon plume. The primary drivers in structuring the microbial community were nitrogen and hydrocarbons. Annotation of unassembled metagenomic data revealed the most abundant hydrocarbon degradation pathway encoded genes involved in degrading aliphatic and simple aromatics via butane monooxygenase. The activity of key hydrocarbon degradation pathways by sediment microbes was confirmed by determining the mineralization of 14 C-labeled model substrates in the following order: propylene glycol, dodecane, toluene and phenanthrene. Further, analysis of metagenomic sequence data revealed an increase in abundance of genes involved in denitrification pathways in samples that exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s benchmarks for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) compared with those that did not. Importantly, these data demonstrate that the indigenous sediment microbiota contributed an important ecosystem service for remediation of oil in the Gulf. However, PAHs were more recalcitrant to degradation, and their persistence could have deleterious impacts on the sediment ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Leaf defenses have long been studied in the context of plant growth rate, resource availability, and optimal investment theory. Likewise, one of the central modern paradigms of plant ecophysiology, the leaf economics spectrum (LES), has been extensively studied in the context of these factors across ecological scales ranging from global species data sets to temporal shifts within individuals. Despite strong physiological links between LES strategy and leaf defenses in structure, function, and resource investment, the relationship between these trait classes has not been well explored. This study investigates the relationship between leaf defenses and LES strategy across whole-plant ontogeny in three diverse Helianthus species known to exhibit dramatic ontogenetic shifts in LES strategy, focusing primarily on physical and quantitative chemical defenses. Plants were grown under controlled environmental conditions and sampled for LES and defense traits at four ontogenetic stages. Defenses were found to shift strongly with ontogeny, and to correlate strongly with LES strategy. More advanced ontogenetic stages with more conservative LES strategy leaves had higher tannin activity and toughness in all species, and higher leaf dry matter content in two of three species. Modeling results in two species support the conclusion that changes in defenses drive changes in LES strategy through ontogeny, and in one species that changes in defenses and LES strategy are likely independently driven by ontogeny. Results of this study support the hypothesis that leaf-level allocation to defenses might be an important determinant of leaf economic traits, where high investment in defenses drives a conservative LES strategy.},

We asked how life forms from dry and wet regions differ in their leaf traits and trait hyperspace (i.e. trait variation) in early tropical forest succession on abandoned agricultural fields.                                                     We compared 324 early successional species from six life forms (herbs, grasses, vines, lianas, shrubs and trees) that occur in the first 5\,years of succession on abandoned fields in Ghanaian wet and drought deciduous tropical forests. We measured 12 leaf traits that are important for carbon, water and nutrient use.                                                     A principal component analysis showed that 46\% of trait variation is captured by a two‐dimensional spectrum of plant form and function: a leaf economics spectrum underpinning fast‐slow growth strategies, and a leaf size spectrum related to plant size and heat balance, which underlie species sorting along environmental gradients in space and time (during succession). Herbaceous and woody life forms had different leaf economics strategies: herbaceous species had more acquisitive trait values (e.g. higher leaf nutrient concentrations) that increase resource capture and use efficiency whereas woody species had more conservative trait values (e.g. higher leaf mass per area) that increase resource conservation. Regardless of life forms, dry forest species and deciduous species had more acquisitive trait values than wet forest species and evergreen species as they maximize their growth during the shorter growing season. The trait hyperspace was larger for woody life forms especially in wet forests.                                                                          Synthesis                     . Herbaceous species had ‘faster’ leaf economics trait values and, hence, rapid carbon gain, explaining their success earlier in succession. In contrast, woody species had ‘slower’ resource conservation trait values that increase persistence, thus explaining their success later in succession. Deciduous species especially in a dry region had higher leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentration to attain faster carbon gain to cope with a seasonally harsh environment. The trait hyperspace was generally smaller in the dry forest, as there are more deciduous species, and as a result, there is less variation in leaf lifespan and associated traits.

Previous nonparametric methods have succeeded in one or other of these areas, but not in both. A recent contribution to Ecological Monographs by Legendre and Anderson, called distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA), does achieve both. It does this by calculating principal coordinates and subsequently correcting for negative eigenvalues, if they are present, by adding a constant to squared distances. We show here that such a correction is not necessary. Partitioning can be achieved directly from the distance matrix itself, with no corrections and no eigenanalysis, even if the distance measure used is semimetric. An ecological example is given to show the differences in these statistical methods. Empirical simulations, based on parameters estimated from real ecological species abundance data, showed that db-RDA done on multifactorial designs (using the correction) does not have type 1 error consistent with the significance level chosen for the analysis (i.e., does not provide an exact test), whereas the direct method described and advocated here does.},

  abstract = {We examined geographic variation in the structure and function of salt marsh communities along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. Focusing on the arthropod community in the dominant salt marsh plant Spartina alterniflora, we tested two hypotheses: first, that marsh community structure varies geographically, and second, that two aspects of marsh function (response to eutrophication and addition of dead plant material) also vary geographically. We worked at eleven sites on the Gulf Coast and eleven sites on the Atlantic Coast, dividing each coast up into two geographic areas. Abiotic conditions (tidal range, soil organic content, and water content, but not soil salinity), plant variables (Spartina nitrogen content, height, cover of dead plant material, but not live Spartina percent cover or light interception), and arthropod variables (proportional abundances of predators, sucking herbivores, stem-boring herbivores, parasitoids, and detritivores, but not total arthropod numbers) varied among the four geo-graphic regions. Latitude and mean tidal range explained much of this geographic variation. Nutrient enrichment increased all arthropod functional groups in the commu-nity, consistent with previous experimental results, and had similar effects in all geographic regions, contrary to our hypothesis, suggesting widespread consistency in this aspect of ecosystem function. The addition of dead plant material had surprisingly little effect on the arthropod community. Our results caution against the uncritical extrapolation of work done in one geographic region to another, but indicate that some aspects of marsh function may operate in similar ways in different geographic regions, despite spatial variation in community structure.},

Here, we synthesize published studies on trophic relationships and oil sensitivity to identify critical taxa in the response of marsh food webs to the oil spill. Taxa such as carnivorous marsh fishes are expected to enhance resilience, while gulls, terns, and omnivorous snails may destabilize the food web. Our framework for identi- fying key taxa can be applied to other environmental stressors or ecosystems if both the sensitivity of individual taxa to a stressor and the food web structure are known.}

Of tested endophytic morphospecies, 40\% (21/52), 65\% (28/43) and 27\% percent (4/15) showed in vitro antagonism against Moniliophthora roreri (frosty pod rot), Phytophthora palmivora (black pod rot) and Moniliophthora perniciosa (witches broom), respectively. The most common antagonistic mechanism was simple competition for substrate. Nonetheless, 13\%, 21\%, and 0\% of tested morphospecies showed clear antibiosis against M. roreri, P. palmivora, and M. perniciosa, respectively. One isolate of Trichoderma was observed to be parasitic on M. roreri. Endophyte species that were common in the host plants under natural conditions often are good colonizers and grow fast in vitro whereas antibiosis producers usually appear to be relatively rare in nature, tend to grow slowly in vitro, and often are not good colonizers. We suggest that there is an inherent general trade-off between fast growth (high colonization) and production of chemicals that produce antibiosis reactions. Finally, field trials assessing the effects of three endophytic fungi (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Clonostachys rosea and Botryosphaeria ribis) on pod loss due to M. roreri and Phytophthora spp. were conducted at four farms in Panama. Although the overall incidence of black pod rot was very low during the tests, treatment with C. gloeosporioides significantly decreased pod loss due to that disease. We observed no decrease in pod loss due to frosty pod rot, but treatment with C. rosea reduced the incidence of cacao pods with sporulating lesions of M. roreri by 10\%. The observed reduction in pod loss due to Phytophthora spp., and sporulation by M. roreri, supports the potential of fungal endophytes as biological control agents. Further, these studies suggest that combined information from field censuses of endophytic fungi, in vitro studies, and greenhouse experiments can provide useful a priori criteria for identifying desirable attributes for potential biocontrol agents. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Consequently, identifying benefits and costs of symbioses, as well as mechanisms underlying them are research priorities. All plants surveyed under natural conditions harbor foliar endophytic fungi (FEF) in their leaf tissues, often at high densities. Despite producing no visible effects on their hosts, experiments have nonetheless shown that FEF reduce pathogen and herbivore damage. Here, combining results from three genomic, and two physiological experiments, we demonstrate pervasive genetic and phenotypic effects of the apparently asymptomatic endophytes on their hosts. Specifically, inoculation of endophyte-free (E-) Theobroma cacao leaves with Colletotrichum tropicale (E+), the dominant FEF species in healthy T. cacao, induces consistent changes in the expression of hundreds of host genes, including many with known defensive functions. Further, E+ plants exhibited increased lignin and cellulose content, reduced maximum rates of photosynthesis (Amax), and enrichment of nitrogen-15 and carbon-13 isotopes. These phenotypic changes observed in E+ plants correspond to changes in expression of specific functional genes in related pathways. Moreover, a cacao gene (Tc00g04254) highly up-regulated by C. tropicale also confers resistance to pathogen damage in the absence of endophytes or their products in host tissues. Thus, the benefits of increased pathogen resistance in E+ plants are derived in part from up-regulation of intrinsic host defense responses, and appear to be offset by potential costs including reduced photosynthesis, altered host nitrogen metabolism, and endophyte heterotrophy of host tissues. Similar effects are likely in most plant-endophyte interactions, and should be recognized in the design and interpretation of genetic and phenotypic studies of plants.},

Closely integrated groups of traits (i.e. trait dimensions) are used to classify plant phenotypic diversity into plant strategies, but we do not know the degree of interdependence among trait dimensions. To assess how selection has shaped the phenotypic space, we examine whether trait dimensions are independent. We gathered data on saplings of 24 locally coexisting tree species in a temperate forest, and examined the correlation structure of 20 leaf, branch, stem and root traits. These traits fall into three well-established trait dimensions (the leaf economic spectrum, the wood spectrum and Corner's Rules) that characterize vital plant functions: resource acquisition, sap transport, mechanical support and canopy architecture. Using ordinations, network analyses and Mantel tests, we tested whether the sapling phenotype of these tree species is organized along independent trait dimensions. Across species, the sapling phenotype is not structured into clear trait dimensions. The trait relationships defining trait dimensions are either weak or absent and do not dominate the correlation structure of the sapling phenotype as a whole. Instead traits from the three commonly recognized trait dimensions are organized into an integrated trait network. The effect of phylogeny on trait correlations is minimal. Our results indicate that trait dimensions apparent in broad-based interspecific surveys do not hold up among locally coexisting species. Furthermore, architectural traits appear central to the phenotypic network, suggesting a pivotal role for branching architecture in linking resource acquisition, mechanical support and hydraulic functions. Synthesis. Our study indicates that local and global patterns of phenotypic integration differ and calls into question the use of trait dimensions at local scales. We propose that a network approach to assessing plant function more effectively reflects the multiple trade-offs and constraints shaping the phenotype in locally co-occurring species.},

  abstract = {299884: The oil from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico was documented as stranding on 1,773 kilometers (km; 1,102 miles) of shoreline as of May 2013. Of the shorelines oiled, beaches comprised 50.8\%, marshes 44.9\%, and other shoreline types 4.3\%. One year after the spill began, oil remained on 830 km; two years later, oil remained on 685 km and three years later, oil remained on 632 km, with 74\% of the shoreline classified as trace ({$<$}1\%) oiling degree. Shoreline cleanup activities were authorized on 660 km, or 73.3\% of oiled beaches. Because the oil stranded over a three-month period and at a period in time when the beaches were in a relatively eroded condition, the oil became deeply buried and posed many challenges to its removal. The continued remobilization of oil buried in both intertidal and nearshore habitats resulted in the chronic re-oiling of sand beaches at trace levels for over three years, thus the slow rate of decline in the shoreline oiled lengths. Treatment of sand beaches in the first year focused on use of mechanical beach cleaners and excavation and sifting of deeply buried oil to minimize clean sediment removal. Later treatments were mostly manual except for mechanical excavation of deeply buried oil in Louisiana beaches in 2012 and 2013. Passive, manual, and mechanical treatments were authorized on 71 km, or 8.9\% of oiled marshes and associated habitats, though actual treatment was conducted in smaller zones within these segments. Intensive marsh cleanup treatments were limited to \textasciitilde 1-2\% of oiled marshes Gulf-wide and focused on areas with thick persistent marsh oiling. The Shoreline Cleanup Assessment Technique (SCAT) Program was the most complex and long lasting of any past spill. The SCAT Program evolved as needed to support the changing requirements and many challenges over the duration of the response. Many of the tools and products developed and used will be of value for future spill responses.}

  abstract = {© 2019 The Authors. While the endosymbiotic communities recruited by plants are known to vary among host species and across environmental gradients, the drivers of community assembly remain poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that establishment of an endosymbiotic bacterial community is driven primarily by the influence of the abiotic environment on biotic interactions between plant and soil bacteria. We planted sterile Jatropha curcas seedlings at three field sites in Panama and in a greenhouse with soil from those sites. After allowing sufficient time for endosymbiont colonization, we sequenced bacterial 16S rRNA to study the endophytic bacterial community in root and leaf tissue. We compared the communities between field and greenhouse plants and examined associations among the endosymbionts, the soil microbial community, and local abiotic factors. We found that endosymbiont richness and community composition varied between the greenhouse and field, despite plants being grown in the same soil. Plants in each field site harbored a distinct bacterial community, determined by soil microbes and select environmental variables, particularly major plant nutrients. Jatropha curcas can harbor a wide variety of endosymbiotic communities, and the composition of these communities is a product of the local environment. Fertility and agricultural practices may determine the fate of plant symbionts and therefore plant properties modulated through those symbionts.},

  abstract = {Tropical forests make an approximately neutral contribution to the global carbon cycle, with intact and recovering forests taking in as much carbon as is released through deforestation and degradation. In the near future, tropical forests are likely to become a carbon source, owing to continued forest loss and the effect of climate change on the ability of the remaining forests to capture excess atmospheric carbon dioxide. This will make it harder to limit global warming to below 2 °C. Encouragingly, recent international agreements commit to halting deforestation and degradation, but a lack of fundamental data for use in monitoring and model design makes policy action difficult.}

  abstract = {Estuarine salinity gradients are known to influence plant, bacterial and archaeal community structure. We sequenced 18S rRNA genes to investigate patterns in sediment fungal diversity (richness and evenness of taxa) and composition (taxonomic and phylogenetic) along an estuarine salinity gradient. We sampled three marshes—a salt, brackish and freshwater marsh—in Rhode Island. To compare the relative effect of the salinity gradient with that of plants, we sampled fungi in plots with Spartina patens and in plots from which plants were removed 2 years prior to sampling. The fungal sediment community was unique compared with previously sampled fungal commu-nities; we detected more Ascomycota (78\%), fewer Basidiomycota (6\%) and more fungi from basal lineages (16\%) (Chytridiomycota, Glomeromycota and four additional groups) than typically found in soil. Across marshes, fungal composition changed substantially, whereas fungal diversity differed only at the finest level of genetic resolution, and was highest in the intermediate, brackish marsh. In contrast, the presence of plants had a highly significant effect on fungal diversity at all levels of genetic resolution, but less of an effect on fungal composition. These results suggest that salinity (or other covarying parameters) selects for a distinctive fungal composition, and plants provide additional niches upon which taxa within these communities can specialize and coexist. Given the number of sequences from basal fungal lineages, the study also suggests that further sampling of estuarine sediments may help in understanding early fungal evolution.},

Based on current models of climate change, reduction in precipitations and in turn, increase in the soil salinity will be a sharp constraint for crops productivity worldwide. In this context, root fungi appear as a new strategy to improve plant ecophysiological performance and crop yield under abiotic stress. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the two fungal endophytes Penicillium brevicompactum and P. chrysogenum isolated from Antarctic plants on nutrients and Na+ contents, net photosynthesis, water use efficiency, yield and survival in tomato and lettuce, facing salinity stress conditions. Inoculation of plant roots with fungal endophytes resulted in greater fresh and dry biomass production, and an enhanced survival rate under salt conditions. Inoculation of plants with the fungal endophytes was related with a higher up/down-regulation of ion homeostasis by enhanced expression of the NHX1 gene. The two endophytes diminished the effects of salt stress in tomato and lettuce, provoked a higher efficiency in photosynthetic energy production and an improved sequestration of Na+ in vacuoles is suggested by the upregulating of the expression of vacuolar NHX1 Na+/H+ antiporters. Promoting plant-beneficial interactions with root symbionts appears to be an environmentally friendly strategy to mitigate the impact of climate change variables~on crop production.}

The ants' pest status is briefly assessed from both ecological and evolutionary points of view. A general overview of control measures is provided. Leaf-cutting ants have evolved physical, symbiotic and behavioural mechanisms that allow them to overcome the chemical, biological, mechanical and cultural methods that have been used to manage their populations.

Theory also predicts that predators feeding on predators, or intraguild predation, will weaken trophic cascades. Although past syntheses have confirmed cascading effects of terrestrial arthropod predators, we lack a comprehensive analysis for vertebrate insectivores - which by virtue of their body size and feeding habits are often top predators in these systems - and of how intraguild predation mediates trophic cascade strength. We report here on ameta-analysis of 113 experiments documenting the effects of insectivorous birds, bats, or lizards on predaceous arthropods, herbivorous arthropods, and plants. Although vertebrate insectivores fed as intraguild predators, strongly reducing predaceous arthropods (38\%), they nevertheless suppressed herbivores (39\%), indirectly reduced plant damage (40\%), and increased plant biomass (14\%). Furthermore, effects of vertebrate insectivores on predatory and herbivorous arthropods were positively correlated. Effects were strongest on arthropods and plants in communities with abundant predaceous arthropods and strong intraguild predation, but weak in communities depauperate in arthropod predators and intraguild predation. The naturally occurring ratio of arthropod predators relative to herbivores varied tremendously among the studied communities, and the skew to predators increased with site primary productivity and in trees relative to shrubs. Although intraguild predation among arthropod predators has been shown to weaken herbivore suppression, we find this paradigm does not extend to vertebrate insectivores in these communities. Instead, vertebrate intraguild predation is associated with strengthened trophic cascades, and insectivores function as dominant predators in terrestrial plant-arthropod communities.},

To better characterize levels of AMF diversity relevant to ecosystem function, deeper sequencing depth in environmental samples is needed. In this study, Illumina barcoded primers and a bioinformatics pipeline were developed and applied to study AMF diversity and community structure in environmental samples. Methods: Libraries of small subunit ribosomal RNA fragment amplicons were amplified from environmental DNA using a singlestep PCR reaction with barcoded NS31/AML2 primers. Amplicons were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer using version 2, 2 x 250-bp paired-end chemistry, and analyzed using QIIME and RDP Classifier. Results: Sequencing captured 196 to 6416 operational taxonomic units (OTUs; depending on clustering parameters) representing nine AMF genera. Regardless of clustering parameters, similar to 20 OTUs dominated AMF communities (78-87\% reads) with the remaining reads distributed among other OTUs. Analyses also showed significant biogeographic differences in AMF communities and that community composition could be linked to specific edaphic factors. Discussion: Barcoded NS31/AML2 primers and Illumina MiSeq sequencing provide a powerful approach to address AMF diversity and variations in fungal assemblages across host plants, ecosystems, and responses to environmental drivers including global change.}

To assess whether the P. flexilis–AAB association is consistent across years, we re-sampled P. flexilis twigs at Niwot Ridge, CO and characterized needle endophyte communities via 16S rRNA Illumina sequencing. To investigate whether endophytes have access to foliar N2,we incubated twigs with 13N2-enriched air and imaged radioisotope distribution in needles, the first experiment of its kind using 13N. We used the acetylene reduction assay to test for nitrogenase activity within P. flexilis twigs four times from June to September. We found evidence for N2 fixation in P. flexilis foliage. N2 diffused readily into needles and nitrogenase activity was positive across sampling dates. We estimate that this association could provide 6.8–13.6 μgNm-2 d-1 to P. flexilis stands. AAB dominated the P. flexilis needle endophyte community. We propose that foliar endophytes represent a low-cost, evolutionarily stableN2-fixing strategy for long-lived conifers.

Still, there is a knowledge gap regarding the rhizosphere-associated bacterial communities of poplars and their dynamics during the remediation process. It is envisaged that a detailed understanding of rhizosphere-associated microbial populations will greatly contribute to a better design and implementation of rhizoremediation. To investigate the long-term succession of structural and catabolic bacterial communities in oil-polluted soil planted with hybrid poplar, we carried out a 2-year field study. Hybrid aspen (Populus tremula~×~Populus tremuloides) seedlings were planted in polluted soil excavated from an accidental oil-spill site. Vegetated and un-vegetated soil samples were collected for microbial community analyses at seven different time points during the course of 2~years and sampling time points were chosen to cover the seasonal variation in the boreal climate zone. Bacterial community structure was accessed by means of 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing, whereas catabolic diversity was monitored by pyrosequencing of alkane hydroxylase and extradiol dioxygenase genes. We observed a clear succession of bacterial communities on both structural and functional levels from early to late-phase communities. Sphingomonas type extradiol dioxygenases and alkane hydroxylase homologs of Rhodococcus clearly dominated the early-phase communities. The high-dominance/low-diversity functional gene communities underwent a transition to low-dominance/high-diversity communities in the late phase. These results pointed towards increased catabolic capacities and a change from specialist to generalist strategy of bacterial communities during the course of secondary succession.},

While experimental studies typically measure tolerance in response to the intensity of herbivory (i.e., the amount of leaf tissue removed in one attack), the impact of how many times plants are attacked during a growing season (i.e., the frequency of damage) is virtually unexplored. Using experimental defoliations that mimicked patterns of attack by leaf-cutter ants (Atta spp.), we examined how the frequency of herbivory influenced plant tolerance traits in six tree species in Brazil's Cerrado. For 2 years we quantified how monthly and quarterly damage influenced individual survivorship, relative growth rate, plant architecture, flowering, and foliar chemistry. We found that the content of leaf nitrogen (N) increased among clipped individuals of most species, suggesting that Atta influences the allocation of resources in damaged plants. Furthermore, our clipping treatments affected tree architecture in ways thought to promote tolerance. However, none of our focal species exhibited a compensatory increase in growth (increment in trunk diameter) in response to herbivory as relative growth rates were significantly lower in clipped than in unclipped individuals. In addition, the probability of survival was much lower for clipped plants, and lower for plants clipped monthly than those clipped quarterly. For plants that did survive, simulated herbivory dramatically reduced the probability of flowering. Our results were similar across a phylogenetically distinct suite of species, suggesting a potential extendability of these findings to other plant species in this system.}

Spatial variables were generated by applying trend surface analysis and principal coordinates of neighbour matrices. Canonical correspondence analysis was also used to check for driving factors.Our results show that microbial variability is primarily being influenced by environmental rather than spatial patterns.

Furthermore, cosmopolitan phylotypes with relative abundances as high as 80.5\% (fungi) and 74.0\% (actinobacteria) were detected.

The Foraging Ascomycete (FA) hypothesis proposes that saprotrophic fungi can utilize leaves both as dispersal vehicles and as resource havens during times of scarcity. The presence of saprotrophs in leaf endophyte communities has been previously observed but their ability to transfer to non-foliar saprobic substrates has not been well investigated. To assess this ability, we conducted a culture study by placing surface-sterilized leaves from a single tropical angiosperm tree (Nectandra lineatifolia) directly onto sterile wood fragments and incubating them for 6 weeks. Fungi from the wood were subsequently isolated in culture and identified to the genus level by ITS sequences or morphology. Four-hundred and seventy-seven fungal isolates comprising 24 taxa were cultured from the wood. Of these, 70.8\% of taxa (82.3\% of isolates) belong to saprotrophic genera according to the FUNGuild database. Furthermore, 27\% of OTUs (6\% of isolates) were basidiomycetes, an unusually high proportion compared to typical endophyte communities. Xylaria flabelliformis, although absent in our original isolations, formed anamorphic fruiting structures on the woody substrates. We introduce the term viaphyte (literally, “by way of plant”) to refer to fungi that undergo an interim stage as leaf endophytes and, after leaf senescence, colonize other woody substrates via hyphal growth. Our results support the FA hypothesis and suggest that viaphytism may play a significant role in fungal dispersal.},

Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H') and number of DGGE bands showed that rhizosphere bacterial diversity of S. alterniflora populations increased along a latitudinal gradient when all the populations were grown in a common garden. These findings suggest that population variation of S. alterniflora can differentiate the rhizosphere bacterial diversity, and the latitudinal gradient can shape the specific plant-bacterial diversity relationship. Our results adding to the recent literature suggest that invasive plant-soil biota interactions would have clinal variation with environmental gradients and improve our understanding of the mechanisms and processes of plant invasions.},

  abstract = {Plant-microbe interactions are considered to be important processes determining the efficiency of phytoremediation of petroleum pollution, however relatively little is known about how these interactions are influenced by petroleum pollution. In this experimental study using a microcosm approach, we examined how plant ecophysiological traits, soil nutrients and microbial activities were influenced by petroleum pollution in Phragmites australis, a phytoremediating species. Generally, petroleum pollution reduced plant performance, especially at early stages of plant growth. Petroleum had negative effects on the net accumulation of inorganic nitrogen from its organic forms (net nitrogen mineralization (NNM)) most likely by decreasing the inorganic nitrogen available to the plants in petroleum-polluted soils. However, abundant dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) was found in petroleum-polluted soil. In order to overcome initial deficiency of inorganic nitrogen, plants by dint of high colonization of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi might absorb some DON for their growth in petroleum-polluted soils. In addition, through using a real-time polymerase chain reaction method, we quantified hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial traits based on their catabolic genes (i.e. alkB (alkane monooxygenase), nah (naphthalene dioxygenase) and tol (xylene monooxygenase) genes). This enumeration of target genes suggests that different hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria experienced different dynamic changes during phytoremediation and a greater abundance of alkB was detected during vegetative growth stages. Because phytoremediation of different components of petroleum is performed by different hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, plants' ability of phytoremediating different components might therefore vary during the plant life cycle. Phytoremediation might be most effective during the vegetative growth stages as greater abundances of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria containing alkB and tol genes were observed at these stages. The information provided by this study enhances our understanding of the effects of petroleum pollution on plant-microbe interactions and the roles of these interactions in the phytoremediation of petroleum-polluted soil.}

We investigated soil bacterial community structure in a switchgrass stand planted on soil with a history of grassland vegetation at high spatial resolution to determine whether biogeographic trends occurred at the centimeter scale. Moreover, we tested whether such heterogeneity, if present, influenced community structure within or among ecosystems. Pronounced heterogeneity was observed at centimeter scales, with abrupt changes in relative abundance of phyla from sample to sample. At the ecosystem scale ({$>$} 10 m), however, bacterial community composition and structure were subtly, but significantly, altered by fertilization, with higher alpha diversity in fertilized plots. Moreover, by comparing these data with data from 1772 soils from the Earth Microbiome Project, it was found that 20\% of bacterial taxa were shared between their site and diverse globally sourced soil samples, while grassland soils shared approximately 40\% of their operational taxonomic units with the current study. By spanning several orders of magnitude, the analysis suggested that extreme patchiness characterized community structure at smaller scales but that coherent patterns emerged at larger length scales.}

In tropical forests, tree diversity is structured by edaphic factors, climate, and biotic interactions, with seasonality playing an essential role at landscape scales: wetter and less seasonal forests typically harbor higher tree diversity than more seasonal forests. We posited that the abiotic factors shaping tree diversity extend to hyperdiverse symbionts in leaves—fungal endophytes—that influence plant health, function, and resilience to stress. Through surveys in forests across Panama that considered climate, seasonality, and covarying biotic factors, we demonstrate that endophyte richness varies negatively with temperature seasonality. Endophyte community structure and taxonomic composition reflect both temperature seasonality and climate (mean annual temperature and precipitation). Overall our findings highlight the vital role of climate-related factors in shaping the hyperdiversity of these important and little-known symbionts of the trees that, in turn, form the foundations of tropical forest biodiversity.},

The process of salt marsh plant survival in such environment is very intriguing and at the same time poorly understood. The plant–microbe interactions may play a key role in the process of environment and in planta detoxification. In this study, a combination of culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular approaches [enrichment cultures, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), DNA sequencing] were used to investigate the effect of petroleum hydrocarbons (PH) contamination on the structure and function [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) dioxygenase genes] of endophytic bacterial communities of salt marsh plant species (Halimione portulacoides and Sarcocornia perennis) in the estuarine system Ria de Aveiro (Portugal). Pseudomonads dominated the cultivable fraction of the endophytic communities in the enrichment cultures. In a set of fifty isolates tested, nine were positive for genes encoding for PAH dioxygenases (nahAc) and four were positive for plasmid carrying genes encoding PAH degradation enzymes (nahAc). Interestingly, these plasmids were only detected in isolates from most severely PH-polluted sites. The results revealed site-specific effects on endophytic communities, related to the level of PH contamination in the sediment, and plant-species-specific ‘imprints’ in community structure and in genes encoding for PAH dioxygenases. These results suggest a potential ecological role of bacterial plant symbiosis in the process of plant colonization in urban estuarine areas exposed to PH contamination.},

Although endophytic fungi are abundant and diverse in many biomes, they reach their greatest diversity in tropical forests, where they can influence plant physiology, performance and survival. The number of quantitative studies regarding endophytes has increased dramatically in the past two decades, but general rules have not yet emerged regarding the biogeography, host affiliations, local or regional distributions, or phylogenetic diversity of endophytes in most tropical settings. Here, endophytic fungal communities associated with 18 species of eupolypod fern were compared among forest reserves in Panama, Costa Rica and Mexico. Molecular sequence data for {$>$}2000 isolates were used to determine the relationships of host taxonomy, forest (site), and environmental dissimilarity to endophyte community composition. Communities in related ferns differed significantly among forests, reflecting the interplay of geographic distance and environmental dissimilarity. Although the same phyla and classes of fungi were prevalent at each site, they differed in relative abundance. All sites were dominated by the same order (Xylariales), but sites differed in the phylogenetic clustering vs. evenness of their endophyte communities. By addressing the relationship of endophyte communities to host taxonomy, geographic distance and environmental factors, this study complements previous work on angiosperms and contributes to a growing perspective on the factors shaping communities of ecologically important fungi in tropical forests.},

Key measures of leaf mechanical resistance varied c. 500-800-fold among species. Contrary to a long-standing hypothesis, tropical leaves were not mechanically more resistant than temperate leaves. Leaf mechanical resistance was modestly related to rainfall and local light environment. By partitioning leaf mechanical resistance into three different components we discovered that toughness per density contributed a surprisingly large fraction to variation in mechanical resistance, larger than the fractions contributed by lamina thickness and tissue density. Higher toughness per density was associated with long leaf lifespan especially in forest understory. Seldom appreciated in the past, toughness per density is a key factor in leaf mechanical resistance, which itself influences plant-animal interactions and ecosystem functions across the globe. ? 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

Together, they comprise immense species richness, but little is known about the fundamental processes that generate their diversity. Exploration of their population structure is needed, especially with regard to geographic distributions and host affiliations. * Methods: We take a multilocus approach to examine genetic variation within and among populations of Lophodermium australe, an endophytic fungus commonly associated with healthy foliage of pines in the southeastern United States. Sampling focused on two pine species ranging from montane to coastal regions of North Carolina and Virginia. * Key results: Our sampling revealed two genetically distinct groups within Lophodermium australe. Our analysis detected less than one migrant per generation between them, indicating that they are distinct species. The species comprising the majority of isolates (major species) demonstrated a panmictic structure, whereas the species comprising the minority of isolates (cryptic species) demonstrated isolation by distance. Distantly related pine species hosted the same Lophodermium species, and host species did not influence genetic structure. * Conclusions: We present the first evidence for isolation by distance in a foliar fungal endophyte that is horizontally transmitted. Cryptic species may be common among microbial symbionts and are important to delimit when exploring their genetic structure and microevolutionary processes. The hyperdiversity of endophytic fungi may be explained in part by cryptic species without apparent ecological and morphological differences as well as genetic diversification within rare fungal species across large spatial scales.},

We show that these traits are approximately distributed proportional to leaf area instead of mass, as expected for a light-and carbon dioxide–collecting organ. Much of the structure in the mass-normalized LES results from normalizing area-proportional traits by mass. Mass normalization induces strong correlations among area-proportional traits because of large variation among species in leaf mass per area (LMA). The high LMA variance likely reflects its functional relationship with leaf life span. A LES that is independent of mass-or area-normalization and LMA reveals physiological relationships that are inconsistent with those in global vegetation models designed to address climate change.}

  abstract = {© 2018 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. Understanding variation in leaf functional traits—including rates of photosynthesis and respiration and concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus—is a fundamental challenge in plant ecophysiology. When expressed per unit leaf area, these traits typically increase with leaf mass per area (LMA) within species but are roughly independent of LMA across the global flora. LMA is determined by mass components with different biological functions, including photosynthetic mass that largely determines metabolic rates and contains most nitrogen and phosphorus, and structural mass that affects toughness and leaf lifespan (LL). A possible explanation for the contrasting trait relationships is that most LMA variation within species is associated with variation in photosynthetic mass, whereas most LMA variation across the global flora is associated with variation in structural mass. This hypothesis leads to the predictions that (i) gas exchange rates and nutrient concentrations per unit leaf area should increase strongly with LMA across species assemblages with low LL variance but should increase weakly with LMA across species assemblages with high LL variance and that (ii) controlling for LL variation should increase the strength of the above LMA relationships. We present analyses of intra- and interspecific trait variation from three tropical forest sites and interspecific analyses within functional groups in a global dataset that are consistent with the above predictions. Our analysis suggests that the qualitatively different trait relationships exhibited  by different leaf assemblages can be understood by considering the degree to which photosynthetic and structural mass components contribute to LMA variation in a given assemblage.},

PCR with conserved primers and the universal probe for total bacteria allowed relative and absolute quantification. Minor groove binder probes increased the sensitivity of the assays 10- to 100-fold.

Cultivars of perennial ryegrass, a hybrid ryegrass and tall fescue, associated with selected Epichloë fungal endophytes were evaluated in aviary and field experiments for their management potential of three nuisance bird species selected as model systems representative of major bird classifications based on their diet. Granivores, namely European green finches, ate more endophyte-free perennial ryegrass seed than endophyte-infected seed, while the representative omnivores, black-backed gulls, avoided endophyte-enhanced feed pellets. The selected herbivore, Canada geese, showed an aversion to field trial plots sown with endophyte-infected grass containing ergovaline compared with the existing ground cover. Therefore habitat modification using selected grass-endophyte associations offers an effective wildlife management option aimed at reducing birds in problematic areas.},

  abstract = {Views of community assembly have traditionally been based on the contrasting perspectives of the deterministic niche paradigm and stochastic neutral models. This study sought to determine if we could use empirical interventions conceived from a niche and neutral perspective to change the diversity and evenness of the microbial community within a reactor treating wastewater and to see if there was any associated change in the removal of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). The systematic removal of EDCs and micropollutants from biological treatment systems is a major challenge for environmental engineers. We manipulated pairs of bioreactors in an experiment in which “niche” (temporal variation in resource concentration and resource complexity) and “neutral” (community size and immigration) attributes were changed and the effect on the detectable diversity and the removal of steroidal estrogens was evaluated. The effects of manipulations on diversity suggested that both niche and neutral processes are important in community assembly. We found that temporal variation in environmental conditions increased diversity but resource complexity did not. Larger communities had greater diversity but attempting to increase immigration by adding soil had the opposite effect. The effects of the manipulations on EDC removal efficiency were complex. Decreases in diversity, which were associated with a decrease in evenness, were associated with an increase in EDC removal. A simple generalized neutral model (calibrated with parameters typical of wastewater treatment plants) showed that decreases in diversity should lead to the increase in abundance of some ostensibly taxa rare. We conclude that neither niche and neutral perspectives nor the effect of diversity on putative rare functions can be properly understood by naïve qualitative observations. Instead, the relative importance of the key microbial mechanisms must be determined and, ideally, expressed mathematically.},

Photosynthetic traits were strongly coordinated, and specific leaf area predicted mass-based rates of assimilation and respiration; leaf life span predicted many other leaf characteristics. Leaf traits were closely associated with growth, survival, and light requirement of the species. Leaf investment strategies varied on a continuum trading off short-term carbon gain against long-term leaf persistence that, in turn, is linked to variation in whole-plant growth and survival. Leaf traits were good predictors of plant performance, both in gaps and in the forest understory. High growth in gaps is promoted by cheap, short-lived, and physiologically active leaves. High survival in the forest understory is enhanced by the formation of long-lived well protected leaves that reduce biomass loss by herbivory, mechanical disturbance, or leaf turnover. Leaf traits underlay this growth–survival trade-off; species with short-lived, physiologically active leaves have high growth but low survival. This continuum in leaf traits, through its effect on plant performance, in turn gives rise to a continuum in species' light requirements.},

Endophytes interact with, and overlap in function with, other core microbial groups that colonize plant tissues, e.g., mycorrhizal fungi, pathogens, epiphytes, and saprotrophs. Some fungal endophytes affect plant growth and plant responses to pathogens, herbivores, and environmental change; others produce useful or interesting secondary metabolites. Here, we focus on new techniques and approaches that can provide an integrative understanding of the role of fungal endophytes in the plant microbiome. Clavicipitaceous endophytes of grasses are not considered because they have unique properties distinct from other endophytes. Hidden from view and often overlooked, endophytes are emerging as their diversity, importance for plant growth and survival, and interactions with other organisms are revealed.},

Results from the real-time PCR analysis were compared to analysis of the microbial population by a culture-based technique [most probable number (MPN) counts]. Both types of analysis indicated that fertilizer addition to hydrocarbon-contaminated soil stimulated the indigenous bacterial population within 1 year. The proportion of alkB containing microorganisms was positively correlated to the concentration of n-alkanes in the soil. After the concentration of n-alkanes in the soil decreased, the proportion of alkane-degrading microorganisms decreased, but the proportion of total hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms increased, indicating another shift in the microbial community structure and ongoing biodegradation.}

Furthermore, we developed a method based on en- zymatic digestion of plant tissue to improve the isolation efficiency in terms of species richness. The effect of additional plant extract in media that contained yeast and malt extract was ofminor significance,whereas isolations using enzymatic digestion of plant leaf tissue combined with a 1:10 dilution of nutrients revealed a much higher diversity of species. Using this protocol,we isolated three times asmany species from the same leaves than with previously described methods.

Observed responses to altered salinity levels include differences in photosynthetic performance, respiration, and increased bleaching and mortality of the coral host and its algal symbiont, but a study looking at bacterial community changes is lacking. Here we exposed the coral Fungia granulosa to strongly increased salinity levels in short- and long-term experiments to disentangle temporal and compartment effects of the coral holobiont (i.e. coral host, symbiotic algae, and associated bacteria). Our results show a significant reduction in calcification and photosynthesis, but a stable microbiome after short-term exposure to high salinity levels. By comparison, long-term exposure yielded unchanged photosynthesis levels and visually healthy coral colonies indicating long-term acclimation to high salinity levels that were accompanied by a major coral microbiome restructuring. Importantly, a bacterium in the family Rhodobacteraceae was succeeded by Pseudomonas veronii as the numerically most abundant taxon. Further, taxonomy-based functional profiling indicates a shift in the bacterial community towards increased osmolyte production, sulfur oxidation, and nitrogen fixation. Our study highlights that bacterial community composition in corals can change within days to weeks under altered environmental conditions, where shifts in the microbiome may enable adjustment of the coral to a more advantageous holobiont composition.

The potential use of endophytes to indicate vitality has been previously realized, but a standard protocol has yet to be developed due to an incomplete understanding of the factors that regulate endophyte communities. Using a culture-free molecular approach, we examined the extent to which host genotype influences the abundance, species richness, and community composition of endophytic fungi in Norway spruce needles. Briefly, total DNA was extracted from the surface-sterilized needles of 30 clones grown in a nursery field and the copy number of the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal DNA was estimated by quantitative PCR. Fungal species richness and community composition were determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing. We found that community structure and ITS copy number varied among spruce clones, whereas species richness did not. Host traits interacting with endophyte communities included needle surface area and the location of cuttings in the experimental area. Although Lophodermium piceae is considered the dominant needle endophyte of Norway spruce, we detected this species in only 33 \% of samples. The most frequently observed fungus (66 \%) was the potentially pathogenic Phoma herbarum. Interestingly, ITS copy number of endophytic fungi correlated negatively with the richness of ectomycorrhizal fungi and thus potential interactions between fungal communities and their influence on the host tree are discussed. Our results suggest that in addition to environmental factors, endophyte communities of spruce needles are determined by host tree identity and needle surface area. © 2013 The British Mycological Society.},

We elucidated the possible roles of antioxidants in symbiotic association between mangroves and their endophytic fungi. Four different mangrove species and the predominant endophytic fungus Aspergillus flavus were analyzed using various in vitro assay systems (such as iron chelating capacity, reducing power, and hydroxyl radicals/hydrogen peroxide/1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging and inhibition of lipid peroxidation using the beta-carotene-linoleate model system). In vitro models clearly established the antioxidant potency of extracts of mangrove plants and their respective endophytic fungi, which aids in understanding the mutualistic associations of plant and endophyte against various biotic and abiotic stresses. Re-infection analysis of endophytic A. flavus in tobacco plants confirmed the endophytic status of the fungus and its enhancement effect on plant growth.}

Although not adapted to salt or drought stress, two commercial rice varieties achieved tolerance to these stresses by colonizing them with Class 2 fungal endophytes isolated from plants growing across moisture and salinity gradients.Plant growth and development, water usage, ROS sensitivity and osmolytes were measured with and without stress under controlled conditions.The endophytes conferred salt, drought and cold tolerance to growth chamber and greenhouse grown plants. Endophytes reduced water consumption by 20-30\% and increased growth rate, reproductive yield, and biomass of greenhouse grown plants. In the absence of stress, there was no apparent cost of the endophytes to plants, however, endophyte colonization decreased from 100\% at planting to 65\% compared to greenhouse plants grown under continual stress (maintained 100\% colonization).These findings indicate that rice plants can exhibit enhanced stress tolerance via symbiosis with Class 2 endophytes, and suggest that symbiotic technology may be useful in mitigating impacts of climate change on other crops and expanding agricultural production onto marginal lands.}

Similar to other plant communities, nutrient availability is one of the major factors influencing mangrove forest structure and productivity. Many mangrove soils have extremely low nutrient availability, although nutrient availability can vary greatly among and within mangrove forests. Nutrient-conserving processes in mangroves are well developed and include evergreeness, resorption of nutrients prior to leaf fall, the immobilization of nutrients in leaf litter during decomposition, high root/shoot ratios and the repeated use of old root channels. Both nitrogen-use efficiency and nutrient resorption efficiencies in mangroves are amongst the highest recorded for angiosperms. A complex range of interacting abiotic and biotic factors controls the availability of nutrients to mangrove trees, and mangroves are characteristically plastic in their ability to opportunistically utilize nutrients when these become available. Nitrogen and phosphorus have been implicated as the nutrients most likely to limit growth in mangroves. Ammonium is the primary form of nitrogen in mangrove soils, in part as a result of anoxic soil conditions, and tree growth is supported mainly by ammonium uptake. Nutrient enrichment is a major threat to marine ecosystems. Although mangroves have been proposed to protect the marine environment from land-derived nutrient pollution, nutrient enrichment can have negative consequences for mangrove forests and their capacity for retention of nutrients may be limited.},

All three systems exhibit a patchy distribution of Juncus roemerianus stands within a Spartina alterniflora marsh. Sediment samples were collected from the interior of several J. roemerianus stands as well as from the S. alterniflora matrix. Samples were assayed for extracellular enzyme activity and DNA extracted to determine microbial community composition. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of rRNA gene fragments was used to determine regional patterns in bacterial, archaeal, and fungal assemblages, while Illumina sequencing was used to examine local, vegetation-driven, patterns in community structure at one site. Both enzyme activity and microbial community structure were primarily influenced by regional site. Within individual saltmarshes, bacterial and archaeal communities differed between J. roemerianus and S. alterniflora vegetated sediments, while fungal communities did not. These results highlight the importance of the plant community in shaping the sediment microbial community in saltmarshes but also demonstrate that regional scale factors are at least as important.},

Both arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) as well as other root endophytic fungi co-occur in plant roots, and therefore have the potential to influence relative abundances of plant species in local assemblages. However, no study has experimentally examined how these key root endosymbiont groups might interact and affect plant community composition. Here, using an assemblage of five plant species in mesocosms in a fully factorial experiment, we added an assemblage of AM fungi and/or a mixture of root endophytic fungal isolates, all obtained from the same grassland field site. The results demonstrate that the AM fungi and root endophytes interact to affect plant community composition by changing relative species abundance, and consequently aboveground productivity. Our study highlights the need to explicitly consider interactions of root-inhabiting fungal groups in studies of plant assemblages.},

The present study was conducted to document the endophytic fungal communities occurring in the vegetation being transported by workers of Atta laevigata into their nests and to compare this community structure with that of the vegetative material subsequently rejected from the nests. We found considerable diversity in the fungi isolated. Acremonium, Cylindrocladium, Drechslera, Epicoccum, Fusarium, Trichoderma, Ulocladium and two unidentified morphospecies were significantly more common in rejected compared with foraged material, and some of these genera include mycoparasites, which could represent a threat to the fungal gardens. Conversely, Colletotrichum, Pestalotiopsis, Phomopsis, Xylaria and an unidentified morphospecies were more common in carried compared with rejected material.

If endophytes antagonistic to Leucoagaricus were found in plant material being carried by these ants, then this might indicate a potential mechanism for plants to defend themselves from leaf-cutter attack. In addition, it could offer possibilities for the management of these important Neotropical pests. Here, we show that, for Atta sexdens rubropilosa, there was a significantly greater incidence of Trichoderma species in the vegetation removed from the nests-and deposited around the entrances-than in that being transported into the nests. In a no-choice test, Trichoderma-infested rice was taken into the nest, with deleterious effects on both the fungal gardens and ant survival. The endophytic ability of selected strains of Trichoderma was also confirmed, following their inoculation and subsequent reisolation from seedlings of eucalyptus. These results indicate that endophytic fungi which pose a threat to ant fungal gardens through their antagonistic traits, such as Trichoderma, have the potential to act as bodyguards of their plant hosts and thus might be employed in a Trojan-horse strategy to mitigate the negative impact of leaf-cutting ants in both agriculture and silviculture in the Neotropics. We posit that the ants would detect and evict such 'malign' endophytes-artificially inoculated into vulnerable crops-during the quality-control process within the nest, and, moreover, that the foraging ants may then be deterred from further harvesting of 'Trichoderma-enriched' plants.},

Analysis of Colletotrichum species indicates that individual isolates can express either parasitic or mutualistic lifestyles depending on the host genotype colonized. The endophyte colonization pattern and lifestyle expression indicate that plants can be discerned as either disease, non-disease, or non-hosts. Fitness benefits conferred by fungi expressing mutualistic lifestyles include biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, growth enhancement, and increased reproductive success. Analysis of plant-endophyte associations in high stress habitats revealed that at least some fungal endophytes confer habitat-specific stress tolerance to host plants. Without the habitat-adapted fungal endophytes, the plants are unable to survive in their native habitats. Moreover, the endophytes have a broad host range encompassing both monocots and eudicots, and confer habitat-specific stress tolerance to both plant groups.},

Symbiotically conferred stress tolerance is a habitat-specific phenomenon with geothermal endophytes conferring heat but not salt tolerance, and coastal endophytes conferring salt but not heat tolerance. The same fungal species isolated from plants in habitats devoid of salt or heat stress did not confer these stress tolerances. Moreover, fungal endophytes from agricultural crops conferred disease resistance and not salt or heat tolerance. We define habitat-specific, symbiotically-conferred stress tolerance as habitat-adapted symbiosis and hypothesize that it is responsible for the establishment of plants in high-stress habitats. The agricultural, coastal and geothermal plant endophytes also colonized tomato (a model eudicot) and conferred disease, salt and heat tolerance, respectively. In addition, the coastal plant endophyte colonized rice (a model monocot) and conferred salt tolerance. These endophytes have a broad host range encompassing both monocots and eudicots. Interestingly, the endophytes also conferred drought tolerance to plants regardless of the habitat of origin. Abiotic stress tolerance correlated either with a decrease in water consumption or reactive oxygen sensitivity/generation but not to increased osmolyte production. The ability of fungal endophytes to confer stress tolerance to plants may provide a novel strategy for mitigating the impacts of global climate change on agricultural and native plant communities.},

Despite more than 100 yr of research resulting in thousands of journal articles, the ecological significance of these fungi remains poorly characterized. Historically, two endophytic groups (clavicipitaceous (C) and nonclavicipitaceous (NC)) have been discriminated based on phylogeny and life history traits. Here, we show that NC-endophytes represent three distinct functional groups based on host colonization and transmission, in planta biodiversity and fitness benefits conferred to hosts. Using this framework, we contrast the life histories, interactions with hosts and potential roles in plant ecophysiology of C- and NC-endophytes, and highlight several key questions for future work in endophyte biology. © 2009 New Phytologist.},

It is designed as an alternative to the widely used USEARCH tool (Edgar, 2010) for which the source code is not publicly available, algorithm details are only rudimentarily described, and only a memory-confined 32-bit version is freely available for academic use.                                         Methods               When searching nucleotide sequences, VSEARCH uses a fast heuristic based on words shared by the query and target sequences in order to quickly identify similar sequences, a similar strategy is probably used in USEARCH. VSEARCH then performs optimal global sequence alignment of the query against potential target sequences, using full dynamic programming instead of the seed-and-extend heuristic used by USEARCH. Pairwise alignments are computed in parallel using vectorisation and multiple threads.                                         Results                                VSEARCH includes most commands for analysing nucleotide sequences available in USEARCH version 7 and several of those available in USEARCH version 8, including searching (exact or based on global alignment), clustering by similarity (using length pre-sorting, abundance pre-sorting or a user-defined order), chimera detection (reference-based or                 de novo                 ), dereplication (full length or prefix), pairwise alignment, reverse complementation, sorting, and subsampling. VSEARCH also includes commands for FASTQ file processing, i.e., format detection, filtering, read quality statistics, and merging of paired reads. Furthermore, VSEARCH extends functionality with several new commands and improvements, including shuffling, rereplication, masking of low-complexity sequences with the well-known DUST algorithm, a choice among different similarity definitions, and FASTQ file format conversion. VSEARCH is here shown to be more accurate than USEARCH when performing searching, clustering, chimera detection and subsampling, while on a par with USEARCH for paired-ends read merging. VSEARCH is slower than USEARCH when performing clustering and chimera detection, but significantly faster when performing paired-end reads merging and dereplication.

It is not known whether these contrasting ecological modes are optional strategies expressed by individual Colleto-trichum species or whether a species' ecology is explicitly pathogenic or endophytic. We explored this question by inferring relationships among 77 C. gloeosporioides s.l. strains isolated from asymptomatic leaves and from anthracnose lesions on leaves and fruits of Theobroma cacao (cacao) and other plants from Panam?. ITS and 5'-tef1 were used to assess diversity and to delineate operational taxonomic units for multilocus phylogenetic analysis. The ITS and 5'-tef1 screens concordantly resolved four strongly supported lineages, clades A-D: Clade A includes the ex type of C. gloeosporioides, clade B includes the ex type ITS sequence of C. boninense, and clades C and D are unidentified. The ITS yielded limited resolution and support within all clades, in particular the C. gloeosporioides clade (A), the focal lineage dealt with in this study. In contrast the 5'-tef1 screen differentiated nine distinctive haplotype subgroups within the C. gloeosporioides clade that were concordant with phylogenetic terminals resolved in a five-locus nuclear phylogeny. Among these were two phylogenetic species associated with symptomatic infections specific to either cacao or mango and five phylogenetic species isolated principally as asymptomatic infections from cacao and other plant hosts. We formally describe two new species, C. tropicale and C. ignotum, that are frequent asymptomatic associates of cacao and other Neotropical plant species, and epitypify C. theobromicola, which is associated with foliar and fruit anthracnose lesions of cacao. Asymptomatic Colletotrichum strains isolated from cacao plants grown in China included six distinct C. gloeosporioides clade taxa, only one of which is known to occur in the Neotropics. ? 2010 by The Mycological Society of America.},

  abstract = {A theory of the origin of eukaryotic cells ("higher" cells which divide by classical mitosis) is presented. By hypothesis, three fundamental organelles: the mitochondria, the photosynthetic plastids and the (9+2) basal bodies of flagella were themselves once free-living (prokaryotic) cells. The evolution of photosynthesis under the anaerobic conditions of the early atmosphere to form anaerobic bacteria, photosynthetic bacteria and eventually blue-green algae (and protoplastids) is described. The subsequent evolution of aerobic metabolism in prokaryotes to form aerobic bacteria (protoflagella and protomitochondria) presumably occurred during the transition to the oxidizing atmosphere. Classical mitosis evolved in protozoan-type cells millions of years after the evolution of photosynthesis. A plausible scheme for the origin of classical mitosis in primitive amoeboflagellates is presented. During the course of the evolution of mitosis, photosynthetic plastids (themselves derived from prokaryotes) were symbiotically acquired by some of these protozoans to form the eukaryotic algae and the green plants. The cytological, biochemical and paleontological evidence for this theory is presented, along with suggestions for further possible experimental verification. The implications of this scheme for the systematics of the lower organisms is discussed.}

However, endophyte-host interactions are based on mutual exploitation. Benefits to the partners are rarely symmetric and conflicting selection forces are likely to destabilize them.

Editor: Petr Baldrian ABSTRACT Fungal communities are important for carbon (C) transformations in boreal forests that are one of the largest C pools in terrestrial ecosystems, warranting thus further investigation of fungal community dynamics in time and space. We investigated fungal diversity and community composition seasonally and across defined soil horizons in boreal Scots pine forest in Finland using 454 pyrosequencing. We collected a total of 120 samples from five vertical soil horizons monthly from March to October; in March, under snow. Boreal forest soil generally harbored diverse fungal communities across soil horizons. The communities shifted drastically and rapidly over time. In late winter, saprotrophs dominated the community and were replaced by ectomycorrhizal fungi during the growing season. Our studies are among the first to dissect the spatial and temporal dynamics in boreal forest ecosystems and highlights the ecological importance of vertically distinct communities and their rapid seasonal dynamics. As climate change is predicted to result in warmer and longer snow-free winter seasons, as well as increase the rooting depth of trees in boreal forest, the seasonal and vertical distribution of fungal communities may change. These changes are likely to affect the organic matter decomposition by the soil-inhabiting fungi and thus alter organic C pools.},

Its central tenet - that recruits experience high mortality near conspecifics and at high densities - assumes a degree of host specialization in interactions between plants and natural enemies. Studies confirming JC effects have focused primarily on spatial distributions of seedlings and saplings, leaving major knowledge gaps regarding the fate of seeds in soil and the specificity of the soilborne fungi that are their most important antagonists. Here we use a common garden experiment in a lowland tropical forest in Panama to show that communities of seed-infecting fungi are structured predominantly by plant species, with only minor influences of factors such as local soil type, forest characteristics, or time in soil (1- 12 months). Inoculation experiments confirmed that fungi affected seed viability and germination in a host-specific manner and that effects on seed viability preceded seedling emergence. Seeds are critical components of reproduction for tropical trees, and the factors influencing their persistence, survival, and germination shape the populations of seedlings and saplings on which current perspectives regarding forest dynamics are based. Together these findings bring seed dynamics to light in the context of the JC hypothesis, implicating them directly in the processes that have emerged as critical for diversity maintenance in species-rich tropical forests.},

Fungi were isolated from leaf and root tissue of two maize genotypes that produce BXs, and a natural mutant that does not. Isolates representing the species recovered were tested for tolerance to 2-benzoxazolinone (BOA), a toxic BX byproduct. • In seedling roots and mature leaves, the community proportion with low BOA tolerance was significantly greater in BX nonproducers than producers. Mean isolation frequency of Fusarium species was up to 35 times higher in mature leaves of BX producers than nonproducers. • Fungal species with relatively high tolerance to BOA are more abundant in BX producing than BX nonproducing maize. Production of BXs may increase colonization by Fusarium species in maize, including agents of animal toxicosis and yield-reducing disease in maize.

  abstract = {Variation in body formamong human groups is structured by a blend of natural selection driven by local climatic conditions and random genetic drift. However, attempts to test ecogeographic hypotheses have not distinguished between adaptive traits (i.e., those that evolved as a result of selection) and those that evolved as a correlated response to selection on other traits (i.e., nonadaptive traits), compli- cating our understanding of the relationship between climate and morphological distinctions among populations. Here, we use evolu- tionary quantitative methods to test if traits previously identified as supporting ecogeographic hypotheses were actually adaptive by estimating the force of selection on individual traits needed to drive among-group differentiation. Our results show that not all associa- tions between trait means and latitude were caused by selection acting directly on each individual trait. Although radial and tibial length and biiliac and femoral head breadth show signs of responses to directional selection matching ecogeographic hypotheses, the femur was subject to little or no directional selection despite having shorter values by latitude. Additionally, in contradiction to ecogeographic hypotheses, the humerus was under directional selection for longer values by latitude. Responses to directional selection in the tibia and radius induced a nonadaptive correlated response in the humerus that overwhelmed its own trait-specific response to selection. This result emphasizes that mean differences between groups are not good indicators of which traits are adaptations in the absence of informa- tion about covariation among characteristics.}

  abstract = {The patterns of the distribution of fungal species and their potential interactions with trees remain understudied in Neotropical rainforests, which harbor more than 16,000 tree species, mostly dominated by endomycorrhizal trees. Our hy-pothesis was that tree species shape the non-mycorrhizal fun-gal assemblages in soil and litter and that the diversity of fungal communities in these two compartments is partly de-pendent on the coverage of trees in the Neotropical rainforest. In French Guiana, a long-term plantation and a natural forest were selected to test this hypothesis. Fungal ITS1 regions were sequenced from soil and litter samples from within the vicinity of tree species. A broad range of fungal taxa was found, with 42 orders and 14 classes. Significant spatial het-erogeneity in the fungal communities was found without strong variation in the species richness and evenness among the tree plots. However, tree species shaped the fungal assem-blages in the soil and litter, explaining up to 18 \% of the variation among the communities in the natural forest. These results demonstrate that vegetation cover has an important effect on the structure of fungal assemblages inhabiting the soil and litter in Amazonian forests, illustrating the relative impact of deterministic processes on fungal community struc-tures in these highly diverse ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Abstract           Considering it is common to find as much as 100-fold variation in the number of 16S rRNA gene sequences found across samples in a study, researchers need to control for the effect of uneven sequencing effort. How to do this has become a contentious question. Some have argued that rarefying or rarefaction is “inadmissible” because it omits valid data. A number of alternative approaches have been developed to normalize and rescale the data that purport to be invariant to the number of observations. I generated community distributions based on 12 published datasets where I was able to assess the ability of multiple methods to control for uneven sequencing effort. Rarefaction was the only method that could control for variation in uneven sequencing effort when measuring commonly used alpha and beta diversity metrics. Next, I compared the false detection rate and power to detect true differences between simulated communities with a known effect size using various alpha and beta diversity metrics. Although all methods of controlling for uneven sequencing effort had an acceptable false detection rate when samples were randomly assigned to two treatment groups, rarefaction was consistently able to control for differences in sequencing effort when sequencing depth was confounded with treatment group. Finally, the statistical power to detect differences in alpha and beta diversity metrics was consistently the highest when using rarefaction. These simulations underscore the importance of using rarefaction to normalize the number of sequences across samples in amplicon sequencing analyses.                        Importance             Sequencing 16S rRNA gene fragments has become a fundamental tool for understanding the diversity of microbial communities and the factors that affect their diversity. Due to technical challenges, it is common to observe wide variation in the number of sequences that are collected from different samples within the same study. However, the diversity metrics used by microbial ecologists are sensitive to differences in sequencing effort. Therefore, tools are needed to control for the uneven levels of sequencing. This simulation-based analysis shows that despite a longstanding controversy, rarefaction is the most robust approach to control for uneven sequencing effort. The controversy started because of confusion over the definition of rarefaction and violation of assumptions that are made by methods that have been borrowed from other fields. Microbial ecologists should use rarefaction.},

  abstract = {Six DNA regions were evaluated as potential DNA barcodes for Fungi, the second largest kingdom of eukaryotic life, by a multina-tional, multilaboratory consortium. The region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 used as the animal barcode was excluded as a potential marker, because it is difficult to amplify in fungi, often includes large introns, and can be insufficiently vari-able. Three subunits from the nuclear ribosomal RNA cistron were compared together with regions of three representative protein-coding genes (largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, and minichromosome maintenance protein). Although the protein-coding gene regions often had a higher percent of correct identification compared with ribosomal markers, low PCR amplification and sequencing success eliminated them as candidates for a universal fungal barcode. Among the regions of the ribosomal cistron, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region has the highest probability of successful identification for the broadest range of fungi, with the most clearly defined bar-code gap between inter-and intraspecific variation. The nuclear ribosomal large subunit, a popular phylogenetic marker in certain groups, had superior species resolution in some taxonomic groups, such as the early diverging lineages and the ascomycete yeasts, but was otherwise slightly inferior to the ITS. The nuclear ribosomal small subunit has poor species-level resolution in fungi. ITS will be formally proposed for adoption as the primary fungal barcode marker to the Consortium for the Barcode of Life, with the possibil-ity that supplementary barcodes may be developed for particular narrowly circumscribed taxonomic groups.}

We argue that in established mosaic landscapes including old cacao production regions where natural forest has already been reduced to relatively small fragments, a combination of both strategies is needed to conserve biodiversity. After reviewing the evidence for the insufficiency of either strategy alone if applied to such landscapes, the paper focuses on the cacao production landscape of southern Bahia, Brazil, once the world's second largest cacao producer. Here, small remaining areas of Atlantic Forest are embedded in a matrix dominated by traditional cacao agroforests, resulting in a landscape mosaic that has proven favorable to the conservation of the region's high biodiversity. We show that current land use dynamics and public policies pose threats but also offer opportunities to conservation and describe a three-pronged landscape conservation strategy, consisting of (i) expansion of the protected areas system, (ii) promotion of productive yet biodiversity-friendly cacao farming practices, and (iii) assistance to land users to implement legally mandated on-farm reserves and voluntary private reserves. We discuss recent experiences concerning the implementation of this strategy, discuss likely future scenarios, and reflect on the applicability of the Bahian experience to biodiversity rich cacao production regions elsewhere in the tropics. ? 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Horizontal transmission of Wolbachia can also result in the colonization of new mitochondrial lineages. In this study, we present a 15-year-long survey of Wolbachia in the cherry fruit fly Rhagoletis cerasi across Europe and the spatiotemporal distribution of two prevalent strains, wCer1 and wCer2, and associated mitochondrial haplotypes in Germany. Across most of Europe, populations consisted of either 100\% singly (wCer1) infected individuals with haplotype HT1, or 100\% doubly (wCer1\&2) infected individuals with haplotype HT2, differentiated only by a single nucleotide polymorphism. In central Germany, singly infected populations were surrounded by transitional populations, consisting of both singly and doubly infected individuals, sandwiched between populations fixed for wCer1\&2. Populations with fixed infection status showed perfect association of infection and mitochondria, suggesting a recent CI-driven selective sweep of wCer2 linked with HT2. Spatial analysis revealed a range expansion for wCer2 and a large transition zone in which wCer2 splashes appeared to coalesce into doubly infected populations. Unexpectedly, the transition zone contained a large proportion (22\%) of wCer1\&2 individuals with HT1, suggesting frequent intraspecific horizontal transmission. However, this horizontal transmission did not break the strict association between infection types and haplotypes in populations outside the transition zone, suggesting that this horizontally acquired Wolbachia infection may be transient. Our study provides new insights into the rarely studied Wolbachia invasion dynamics in field populations.},

However, abundance, diversity and community structure dif-fered significantly among fern species, and composi-tion differed markedly between sampling years.

As a terrestrial plant community inhabiting tidally inundated estuarine or marine sediments, mangroves show considerable adaptation to salinity, water- logging and nutrient stress. Thirty-one species of man- grove and mangrove associates and 23 species of transport- ed flora, belonging to 25 families at four physiographic stages of succession of the mangrove plant community at the terminal part of the Ganges river estuary in India were examined for arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) root associa- tion. Dominant members of the mangrove plant community were all AM, mostly with ‘Paris’ type structures. Many of the known non-mycotrophic plant families, except the Cyperaceae, also showed AM association, with intracellu- lar hyphae and vesicles as the most discernible endophyte structures. Intensity of AM colonization varied both with the species and situations of their occurrence, being more intense and also more extensive in less saline dry ridge mangroves than in more saline formative and developed swamp mangroves. Introduced exotic trees on the ridges and embankments were infected by AM, but less than the declining mangroves in the same location. Seven species of AM fungi in common with those of the upstream meso- phytic plants were isolated from root-free rhizosphere soils of the mangroves, three of which predominated in root association. These species, individually and as mixtures, infected roots of salinity tolerant herbs and trees in both locational silt and upstream alluvial soil with obvious im- provements in their biomass yield and phosphorus nutri- tion.

We tested hypotheses about the nutrient-processing dynamics governing this functional integration, tracing N-15- and C-13-enriched substrates through colonies of the leafcutter ant Atta colombica. Our results highlight striking performance efficiencies, including rapid conversion (within 2 d) of harvested nutrients into edible fungal tissue (swollen hyphal tips called gongylidia) in the center of fungus gardens, while also highlighting that much of each colony's foraging effort resulted in substrate placed directly in the trash. We also find nutrient-specific processing dynamics both within and across layers of the fungus garden, and in ant consumers. Larvae exhibited higher overall levels of N-15 and C-13 enrichment than adult workers, supporting that the majority of fungal productivity is allocated to colony growth. Foragers assimilated C-13-labeled glucose during its ingestion, but required several days to metabolically process ingested N-15-labeled ammonium nitrate. This processing timeline helps resolve a 40-yr old hypothesis, that foragers (hut apparently not gardeners or larvae) bypass their fungal crops to directly assimilate some of the nutrients they ingest outside the nest. Tracing these nutritional pathways with stable isotopes helps visualize how physiological integration within symbiotic networks gives rise to the ecologically dominant herbivory of leafcutter ants in habitats ranging from Argentina to the southern United States.}

Beet armyworm larvae fed on tomato plants inoculated by either or both types of fungi were found to gain significantly less weight than those fed on control non-inoculated plants.

  abstract = {Plant-bacterial combinations can increase contaminant degradation in the rhizosphere, but the role played by indigenous root-associated bacteria during plant growth in contaminated soils is unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine if plants had the ability to selectively enhance the prevalence of endophytes containing pollutant catabolic genes in unrelated environments contaminated with different pollutants. At petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated sites, two genes encoding hydrocarbon degradation, alkane monooxy-genase (alkB) and naphthalene dioxygenase (ndoB), were two and four times more prevalent in bacteria extracted from the root interior (endophytic) than from the bulk soil and sediment, respectively. In field sites contaminated with nitroaromatics, two genes encoding nitrotoluene degradation, 2-nitrotoluene reductase (ntdAa) and nitrotoluene monooxygenase (ntnM), were 7 to 14 times more prevalent in endophytic bacteria. The addition of petroleum to sediment doubled the prevalence of ndoB-positive endophytes in Scirpus pungens, indicating that the numbers of endophytes containing catabolic genotypes were dependent on the presence and concentration of contaminants. Similarly, the numbers of alkB-or ndoB-positive endophytes in Festuca arundi-nacea were correlated with the concentration of creosote in the soil but not with the numbers of alkB-or ndoB-positive bacteria in the bulk soil. Our results indicate that the enrichment of catabolic genotypes in the root interior is both plant and contaminant dependent. The potential to use plants to remediate polluted soils has recently attracted considerable interest (19, 28, 29, 34). Plants can stimulate contaminant disappearance by accumulation and transformation (30), by extracellular transformation (13, 37) and by stimulating microbial degradative activity in the rhizo-sphere (3, 35). Several authors have investigated the role of microorganisms in phytoremediation, and they have found that certain plant-bacterial associations can increase degradation (1, 8, 11, 33). This suggests that, under certain circumstances, such as in microbially inoculated plants, microorganisms play an important role in phytoremediation systems, but it is not clear what role they play in phytoremediation systems having only indigenous microbial populations. Plants routinely encounter allelopathic compounds, many of which are analogous to organic contaminants (9), and thus there may be a plant response that stimulates microbial de-fenses against a soil toxicant or toxin (48). If this is true, plants could recruit bacteria that contain genotypes specific for toxi-cant degradation into the rhizosphere and root interior, and this selection should be contaminant specific. These bacteria would presumably protect the plant from the phytotoxic effects of the contaminants. In a similar manner, plants growing in herbicide-contaminated soils have high herbicide mineraliza-tion activity in their rhizospheres (2). Inoculating herbicide-degrading bacteria into the rhizosphere also protects plants from the phytotoxic effects of the herbicides (17, 32). The selective pressure of plants on bacterial populations has its maximum effect near the root surface or in the root interior (16, 21, 23). For example, the maximum impact of altering plant genotypes was observed in the root interior of canola with substantially less impact observed on the rhizosphere mi-crobial community (36, 40). Endophytic bacteria enhance the ability of plants to resist pathogens (49), herbivores (10), and other plants (44). Thus, if bacteria do play a role in the plant's ability to tolerate contaminants, we hypothesized that this ef-fect would occur in the endophytic zone. In this study, gene probes for alkane monooxygenase (alkB) (47), naphthalene dioxygenase (ndoB) (41), and catechol-2,3-dioxygenase (xylE) (24) were used to assess the prevalence of bacteria involved in petroleum hydrocarbon degradation. Gene probes developed for the ntdAa and the ntnM genes (38) were used to test for the prevalence of bacteria involved in nitrotoluene metabolism. The ntdAa gene of Pseudomonas sp. strain JS42 encodes the reductase component of the three-component dioxygenase system that converts 2-nitrotoluene to 3-methylcatechol (27). The ntnM gene from Pseudomonas putida encodes the hydroxylase component of nitrotoluene monooxygenase (18). The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of plants on contaminant-degrading bacteria in upland terrestrial or freshwater intertidal environments. The effect of different contaminants, petroleum hydrocarbons, or nitroaromatics was also assessed. A wide range of environments and contaminants}

  title = {A Trophic Cascade Regulates Salt Marsh Primary Production},
  author = {Silliman, Brian Reed and Bertness, Mark D and Paine, Robert T},
  abstract = {Nutrient supply is widely thought to regulate primary production of many ecosystems including salt marshes. However, experimental manipulation of the dominant marsh grazer (the periwinkle, Litto-raria irrorata) and its consumers (e.g., blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus, terrapins, Malaclemys terrapin) demonstrates plant biomass and pro-duction are largely controlled by grazers and their predators. Peri-winkle grazing can convert one of the most productive grasslands in the world into a barren mudflat within 8 months. Marine predators regulate the abundance of this plant-grazing snail. Thus, top-down control of grazer density is a key regulatory determinant of marsh grass growth. The discovery of this simple trophic cascade implies that over-harvesting of snail predators (e.g., blue crabs) may be an im-portant factor contributing to the massive die-off (tens of km 2) of salt marshes across the southeastern United States. In addition, our results contribute to a growing body of evidence indicating wide-spread, predator regulation of marine macrophyte production via trophic cascades (kelps, seagrasses, intertidal algae). A primary goal of ecology is to understand the relative importance of resource availability (bottom-up forces) and consumers (top-down forces) in controlling plant growth. Strong consumer control of plant structure has been demonstrated in a variety of aquatic (1, 2) and marine (3–6) habitats. In these systems, a trophic cascade controls plant biomass. When pred-ators do not suppress densities of potent herbivores, runaway consumption by grazers reduces plant biomass and, ultimately, denudes the substrate. Palatable algae and simple food webs characterize most of these communities (1–6). Thus, it has been suggested (7) that top-down control via trophic cascades may be an idiosyncratic attribute of simple, aquatic systems that are not buffered from run-away consumer effects by multiple predators and͞or omnivory and are characterized by weedy, poorly de-fended primary producers. Recent evidence from temperate (8) and tropical (9) seagrass systems, however, suggests that com-munities dominated by higher, more heavily defended plants, are also susceptible to cascading consumer effects. Western Atlantic salt marshes dominated by vascular plants are among the most productive systems in the world (10). Most research in marshes has focused on physico-chemical factors that influence the success of the dominant macrophyte in the com-munity, Spartina alterniflora (salt marsh cordgrass; ref. 10). The prevailing paradigm in marsh ecology for nearly five decades has been that bottom-up forces are the primary determinants of plant production (10, 11). Early studies in North American salt marshes concluded that plant–herbivore interactions were of little consequence to com-munity dynamics (12–14). None of these investigations, however, experimentally excluded grazers to test explicitly the hypothesis that Spartina growth is unregulated by consumers. All of these studies assumed that dying and senescing marsh plants (detritus) attracted invertebrate grazers and did not test the alternative hypothesis that invertebrate grazers generated these patterns. For nearly half a century, research based on this untested grazer-detrital hypothesis has dominated scientific work within the field and greatly influenced the development of detrital͞ bottom-up paradigms in other marine systems (seagrasses and mangroves; refs. 15 and 16). Recent research in Virginia (USA) marshes which did employ grazer exclusions has challenged current marsh theory and suggests that powerful trophic interactions influence the high primary production observed in these communities. By manipulating both snail and nitrogen (N) levels, a season-long caging experiment (17) demonstrated that the most abundant and widespread grazer in East Coast marshes, the marsh periwinkle (Littoraria irrorata), exerts strong top-down control over cordgrass growth, and that this effect increases with N fertilization.

  abstract = {More than 2 y have passed since the BP–Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, yet we still have little understanding of its ecological impacts. Examining effects of this oil spill will gen-erate much-needed insight into how shoreline habitats and the valuable ecological services they provide (e.g., shoreline protec-tion) are affected by and recover from large-scale disturbance. Here we report on not only rapid salt-marsh recovery (high resil-ience) but also permanent marsh area loss after the BP–Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Field observations, experimental manipulations, and wave-propagation modeling reveal that (i) oil coverage was primarily concentrated on the seaward edge of marshes; (ii) there were thresh-olds of oil coverage that were associated with severity of salt-marsh damage, with heavy oiling leading to plant mortality; (iii) oil-driven plant death on the edges of these marshes more than doubled rates of shoreline erosion, further driving marsh platform loss that is likely to be permanent; and (iv) after 18 mo, marsh grasses have largely recovered into previously oiled, noneroded areas, and the elevated shoreline retreat rates observed at oiled sites have decreased to lev-els at reference marsh sites. This paper highlights that heavy oil cov-erage on the shorelines of Louisiana marshes, already experiencing elevated retreat because of intense human activities, induced a geo-morphic feedback that amplified this erosion and thereby set limits to the recovery of otherwise resilient vegetation. It thus warns of the enhanced vulnerability of already degraded marshes to heavy oil coverage and provides a clear example of how multiple human-in-duced stressors can interact to hasten ecosystem decline. geomorphology | multiple stressor | wetland | human impacts}

  abstract = {Although leaf-cutter ants have been recognized as the dominant herbivore in many Neotropical ecosystems, their role in nutrient cycling remains poorly understood. Here we evaluated the relationship between plant palatability to leaf-cutter ants and litter decomposability. Our rationale was that if preference and decomposability are related, and if ant consumption changes the abundance of litter with different quality, then ant herbivory could affect litter decomposition by affecting the quality of litter entering the soil. The study was conducted in a woodland savanna (cerrado denso) area in Minas Gerais, Brazil. We compared the decomposition rate of litter produced by trees whose fresh leaves have different degrees of palatability to the leaf-cutter ant Atta laevigata. Our experiments did not indicate the existence of a significant relationship between leaf palatability to A. laevigata and leaf-litter decomposability. Although the litter mixture composed of highly palatable plant species showed, initially, a faster decay rate than the mixture of poorly palatable species, this difference was no longer visible after about 6 months. Results were consistent regardless of whether litter invertebrates were excluded or not from litter bags. Similarly, experiments comparing the decomposition rate of litter from pairs of related plant species also showed no association between plant palatability and decomposition. Decomposition rate of the more palatable species was faster, slower or similar to that of the less palatable species depending upon the particular pair of species being compared. We suggest that the traits that mostly influence the decomposition rate of litter produced by cerrado trees may not be the same as those that influence plant palatability to leaf-cutter ants. Atta laevigata select leaves of different species based - at least in part - on their nitrogen content, but N content was a poor predictor of the decomposition rates of the species we studied.}

Similarly to plant seeds, propagules may harbor beneficial bacteria. Our hypothesis was that mangroves, being able to grow into seawater, should harbor bacteria able to interact with the host and to exert positive effects under salt stress, which could be exploited to improve crop production. Therefore, we isolated bacterial endophytes from mangrove propagules with the aim to test whether these bacteria have a beneficial potential on their natural host and on different crops such as barley and rice, cultivated under salt stress. The 172 bacterial isolates obtained were screened for plant growth promotion (PGP) activities in vitro, and the 12 most promising isolates were tested on barley under non-axenic conditions and salt stress. Gordonia terrae KMP456-M40 was the best performing isolate, increasing ear weight by 65\%. Based on the in vivo PGP activity and the root colonization ability, investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy, three strains were additionally tested on mangrove propagule germination and on rice growth. The most effective strain was again G. terrae KMP456-M40, which enhanced the root length of mangrove seedlings and the biomass of salt-stressed rice under axenic conditions up to 65\% and 62\%, respectively. We demonstrated that propagules, the reproductive units of mangroves, host beneficial bacteria that enhance the potential of mangrove seedlings establishment and confer salt tolerance to cereal crops.},

However, E+ plants showed significantly less symptoms of damage, and they produced significantly greater content of chlorophyll, more tillers, higher shoots and higher under-ground biomass compared to E- plants. Waterlogging induced osmoprotective proline production particularly in E+ plants and had lower malondialdehyde content and electrolyte leakage, suggesting that endophyte infection positively affects osmotic potential and oxidative balance of the host plant.

The primary contribution of the OD hypothesis is that it has served as the main framework for investigation of genotypic expression of plant defense, with the emphasis on allocation cost of defense. The primary contribution of the CNB hypothesis is that it has served as the main framework for investigation of how resources affect phenotypic expression of plant defense, often with studies concerned about allocation cost of defense. The primary contribution of the GR hypothesis is that it explains how intrinsic growth rate of plants shaped evolutionarily by resource availability affects defensive patterns. The primary contribution of the expanded GDB hypothesis is that it recognizes the constant physiological tradeoff between growth and differentiation at the cellular and tissue levels relative to the selective pressures of resource availability, including explicitly taking into account plant tolerance of damage by enemies. A clearer understanding of these hypotheses and what we have learned from investigations that use them can facilitate development of well-designed experiments that address the gaps in our knowledge of plant defense.},

In this study we examined the relationship of foliar fungal endophytes to host photosynthetic pathways and associated ecophysiological traits. We sampled the fungal endophyte communities of 67 host individuals in six epiphytic bromeliad species differing in C3 and crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) photosynthetic pathways. We tested whether endophyte assemblages were associated with ecophysiological leaf traits related to host photosynthetic pathways. Our results indicate that (1) C3 and CAM bromeliads host dissimilar endophyte assemblages, (2) endophyte communities in C3 bromeliads are characterized by variable relative abundances of fungal orders; conversely, CAM associated endophyte communities were characterized by consistent relative abundances of fungal orders, and (3) endophyte communities in bromeliads are distributed along a continuum of leaf toughness and leaf water content. Taken together, our study suggests that host physiology and associated ecophysiological traits of epiphytic bromeliads may represent biotic filters for communities of fungal endophytes in the tropics.},

  abstract = {Leaf traits of plants worldwide are classified according to the Leaf Economics Spectrum (LES), which links leaf functional traits to evolutionary life history strategies. As a continuum ranging from thicker, tough leaves that are low in nitrogen (N) to thinner, softer, leaves that are high in N, the LES brings together physical, chemical, and ecological traits. Fungal endophytes are common foliar symbionts that occur in healthy, living leaves, especially in tropical forests. Their community composition often differs among co-occurring host species in ways that cannot be explained by environmental conditions or host phylogenetic relationships. Here, we tested the over-arching hypothesis that LES traits act as habitat filters that shape communities of endophytes both in terms of composition, and in terms of selecting for endophytes with particular suites of functional traits. We used culture-based and culture-free surveys to characterize foliar endophytes in mature leaves of 30 phylogenetically diverse plant species with divergent LES traits in lowland Panama, and then measured functional traits of dominant endophyte taxa               in vitro               . Endophytes were less abundant and less diverse in thick, tough, leaves compared to thin, softer, leaves in the same forest, even in closely related plants. Endophyte communities differed according to leaf traits, including leaf punch strength and carbon and nitrogen content. The most common endophyte taxa in leaves at different ends of the LES differ in their cellulase, protease, chitinase, and antipathogen activity. Our results extend the LES framework for the first time to diverse and ecologically important endophytes, opening new hypotheses regarding the degree to which foliar symbionts respond to, and extend, the functional traits of leaves they inhabit.},

In stochastic niche theory, invading species become established only if propagules can survive stochastic mortality while growing to maturity on the resources left unconsumed by established species. The theory makes three predictions about community structure. First, stochastic niche assembly creates communities in which species dominate approximately equally wide "slices" of the habitat's spatial heterogeneity. These niche widths generate realistic distributions of species relative abundances for which, contrary to neutral theory but consistent with numerous observations, there are strong correlations among species traits, species abundances, and environmental conditions. Second, slight decreases in resource levels are predicted to cause large decreases in the probability that a propagule would survive to be an adult. These decreases cause local diversity to be limited by the inhibitory effects of resource use by established species on the establishment (recruitment) of potential invaders. If resource pulses or disturbance allowed invaders to overcome this recruitment limitation, many more species could indefinitely coexist. Third, the low invasibility of high diversity communities is predicted to result not from diversity per se, but from the uniformly low levels of resources that occur in high-diversity communities created by stochastic competitive assembly. This prediction provides a potential solution to the invasion paradox, which is the tendency for highly diverse regions to be more heavily invaded.}

Nevertheless, these associations could be beneficial for germination and seedling establishment as seed endophytic bacteria are already present in these very early plant growth stages. Moreover, bacteria with beneficial characteristics can be selected by the plants and could be transferred via the seed to benefit the next generation. In this paper, the current literature concerning bacterial endophytes that have been isolated from seeds of different plant species is reviewed. Their colonization routes, localization inside seeds and mode of transmission as well as their role and fate during germination and seedling development are discussed.

However, intrinsic biases and insufficient quality control in next-generation methods can lead to difficult-to-detect errors in estimating fungal community richness, distributions and composition. The aim of this study was to examine how tissue storage prior to DNA extraction, primer design and various quality-control approaches commonly used in 454 amplicon pyrosequencing might influence ecological inferences in studies of endophytic and endolichenic fungi. We first contrast 454 data sets generated contemporaneously from subsets of the same plant and lichen tissues that were stored in CTAB buffer, dried in silica gel or freshly frozen prior to DNA extraction. We show that storage in silica gel markedly limits the recovery of sequence data and yields a small fraction of the diversity observed by the other two methods. Using lichen mycobiont sequences as internal positive controls, we next show that despite careful filtering of raw reads and utilization of current best-practice OTU clustering methods, homopolymer errors in sequences representing rare taxa artificially increased estimates of richness c. 15-fold in a model data set. Third, we show that inferences regarding endolichenic diversity can be improved using a novel primer that reduces amplification of the mycobiont. Together, our results provide a rationale for selecting tissue treatment regimes prior to DNA extraction, demonstrate the efficacy of reducing mycobiont amplification in studies of the fungal microbiomes of lichen thalli and highlight the difficulties in differentiating true information about fungal biodiversity from methodological artefacts.},

Experimental tests of whether bird predation on arthropods can reduce plant damage, however, are few and restricted to relatively low-diversity systems. Here, we describe an experimental test in a diverse tropical forest of whether birds indirectly defend foliage from arthropod herbivores. We also compare how the indirect effects of bird predation vary with different levels of foliage productivity in the canopy vs. the understory. For three Neotropical tree species, we observed that birds decreased local arthropod densities on canopy branches and reduced consequent damage to leaves. In contrast, we observed no evidence of bird-arthropod limitation on conspecific saplings in the less productive understory of the same forest. Our results support theory that predicts trophic cascades where productivity is high and suggest that birds play an important role in Neotropical communities by means of their indirect defense of some canopy tree species.}

The outbreak involved the larvae of at least 12 species of Lepidoptera and occurred at a seasonally dry, deciduous forest site, where extensive background data were available regarding climate, tree species and non-outbreak herbivory levels. Most Lepidoptera were associated with only one or two larval host plant species belonging to the same family, and the majority were monophagous during this study. During the outbreak, caterpillar densities for the major outbreak species averaged 1.6 larvae per young leaf and 0.18 larvae per leaf for leaves of all ages. For canopy trees and lianas, the mean level of leaf damage was 13.8\%, ranging from 1-100\%. Seven out of 20 tree species sustained most of the damage, with 21-37\% of the leaf area consumed. Relative to non-outbreak years, damage levels increased by more than 250\% during the outbreak. Single-species outbreaks were observed in other areas with a similar drought, but wetter forests in central Panama did not experience outbreaks during this period. Historically, fewer outbreaks have been reported from tropical forests than from temperate forests, however, similar El Ni?o-related outbreaks have occurred recently in several other locations throughout the tropics.},

We compared the bird diversity and community structure in organic cacao farms and nearby forest fragments throughout mainland Bocas del Toro, Panama. We used this dataset to ask the following questions: (1) How do bird communities using cacao habitat compare to communities of nearby forest fragments? (2) To what extent do Northern migratory birds use shaded cacao farms, and do communities of resident birds shift their abundances in cacao farms seasonally? (3) Do small scale changes in shade management of cacao farms affect bird diversity? Using fixed radius point counts and additional observations, we recorded 234 landbird species, with 102 species that were observed in both cacao and forest fragments, 86 species that were only observed in cacao farms, and 46 species that were restricted to forest fragments. Cacao farms were rich in canopy and edge species such as tanagers, flycatchers and migratory warblers, but understory insectivores were nearly absent from cacao farms. We observed 27 migratory species, with 18 species in cacao farms only, two species in forest only, and seven species that occurred in both habitats. In cacao farms, the diversity of birds was significantly greater where there was less intensive management of the canopy shade trees. Shade tree species richness was most important for explaining variance in bird diversity. Our study shows that shaded cacao farms in western Panama provide habitat for a wide variety of resident and migratory bird species. Considering current land use trends in the region, we suggest that action must be taken to prevent conversion away from shaded cacao farms to land uses with lower biodiversity conservation value. ? 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The variation in bird effects may be due to characteristics such as plant productivity or quality, habitat complexity, and/or species diversity of predator and prey assemblages. Since agroforestry systems vary in such characteristics, these systems provide a good starting point for understanding when and where we can expect predation by birds to be important. We analyze data from bird exclosure studies in forests and agroforestry systems to ask whether birds consistently reduce their arthropod prey base and whether bird predation differs between forests and agroforestry systems. Further, we focus on agroforestry systems to ask whether the magnitude of bird predation (1) differs between canopy trees and understory plants, (2) differs when migratory birds are present or absent, and (3) correlates with bird abundance and diversity. We found that, across all studies, birds reduce all arthropods, herbivores, carnivores, and plant damage. We observed no difference in the magnitude of bird effects between agroforestry systems and forests despite simplified habitat structure and plant diversity in agroforests. Within agroforestry systems, bird reduction of arthropods was greater in the canopy than the crop layer. Top-down effects of bird predation were especially strong during censuses when migratory birds were present in agroforestry systems. Importantly, the diversity of the predator assemblage correlated with the magnitude of predator effects; where the diversity of birds, especially migratory birds, was greater, birds reduced arthropod densities to a greater extent. We outline potential mechanisms for relationships between bird predator, insect prey, and habitat characteristics, and we suggest future studies using tropical agroforests as a model system to further test these areas of ecological theory. ? 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

All previous studies of endophyte-herbivore interactions have occurred in temperate areas, and many use correlations rather than experiments. In Panama, Glomerella cingulata is a common endophyte species found in healthy leaves, and Chelymorpha alternans is a common herbivore on Merremia umbellata, a tropical vine. We manipulated the abundance of G. cingulata in the leaves of M. umbellata. We then assessed the effects of high and low endophyte densities on the food choice, development, and reproductive success of the leaf beetle, C. alternans. In 'choice' experiments, adult females with a history of feeding on wild plants showed no preference when offered food plants with high and low endophyte densities. Further, in 'no-choice' experiments, C. alternans larvae that were fed high- or low-density endophyte leaves did not differ in development or survivorship. However, when larvae fed on leaves with low endophyte densities became adults, they produced 80 percent more offspring. This suggests high endophyte levels in hosts can have a negative effect on herbivore fecundity. Further experiments are necessary to understand whether the reproductive effects are due to feeding on low-density endophytes in the larval or adult stages, and whether changes in reproductive success are motivated by the adult's perception of food quality or by physiological constraint due to food quality. ? 2009 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.},

Recent studies indicate that many ecological interactions involve alliances of symbionts acting together as mutualistic consortia against other consortia. Such interacting consortia are likely to be widespread in nature, even if the interactions often occur in a cryptic fashion. Little theory and empirical data exist concerning how these complex interactions shape ecological outcomes in nature. Here, we review recent work on fungal-fungal interactions between two consortia: (i) leaf-cutting ants and their symbiotic fungi (the latter grown as a food crop by the former) and (ii) tropical plants and their foliar endophytes (the cryptic symbiotic fungi within leaves of the former). Plant characteristics (e.g., secondary compounds or leaf physical properties of leaves) are involved in leaf-cutting ant preferences, and a synthesis of published information suggests that these plant traits could be modified by fungal presence.

  abstract = {Background: Previous work has shown that leaf-cutting ants prefer to cut leaf material with relatively low fungal endophyte content. This preference suggests that fungal endophytes exact a cost on the ants or on the development of their colonies. We hypothesized that endophytes may play a role in their host plants' defense against leaf-cutting ants. To measure the long-term cost to the ant colony of fungal endophytes in their forage material, we conducted a 20-week laboratory experiment to measure fungal garden development for colonies that foraged on leaves with low or high endophyte content.Results: Colony mass and the fungal garden dry mass did not differ significantly between the low and high endophyte feeding treatments. There was, however, a marginally significant trend toward greater mass of fungal garden per ant worker in the low relative to the high endophyte treatment. This trend was driven by differences in the fungal garden mass per worker from the earliest samples, when leaf-cutting ants had been foraging on low or high endophyte leaf material for only 2 weeks. At two weeks of foraging, the mean fungal garden mass per worker was 77\% greater for colonies foraging on leaves with low relative to high endophyte loads.Conclusions: Our data suggest that the cost of endophyte presence in ant forage material may be greatest to fungal colony development in its earliest stages, when there are few workers available to forage and to clean leaf material. This coincides with a period of high mortality for incipient colonies in the field. We discuss how the endophyte-leaf-cutter ant interaction may parallel constitutive defenses in plants, whereby endophytes reduce the rate of colony development when its risk of mortality is greatest. ? 2012 Van Bael et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

  abstract = {Endophytic fungi in grasses are often considered to be mutualistic because they can increase host resistance to herbivory and drought. However, not all endophytes are beneficial to their hosts, but may instead be specialist enemies. Brachypodium sylvati-cum is an invasive grass in the USA. In its European native range, it is nearly always infected by the host-specific endophyte Epichloë sylvatica. While this fungus decreases herbivory, it also decreases the growth rate and size of infected plants, making them less competitive. After showing that B. sylvaticum has lost its endophyte in the invaded range, we use greenhouse assays to deconfound the effects of endophyte infection and range origin to test assump-tion of the evolution of increased competitive abilities (EICA) hypothesis. Brachypodium in its invaded range appears to have lost tolerance mechanisms present in the native range, allowing Epichloë to greatly increase seedling mortality and reduce growth rates. Additionally, there is some evidence for increased competitive abilities in the form of increased seedling growth rates in the invasive range. Together, these results provide strong support of the EICA hypothesis.},

Indeed, plants harbor a wide diversity of microorganisms both inside and outside their tissues, in the endosphere and ectosphere, respectively. These microorganisms, which mostly belong to Bacteria and Fungi, are involved in major functions such as plant nutrition and plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Hence, the microbiota impact plant growth and survival, two key components of fitness. Plant fitness is therefore a consequence of the plant per se and its microbiota, which collectively form a holobiont. Complementary to the reductionist perception of evolutionary pressures acting on plant or symbiotic compartments, the plant holobiont concept requires a novel perception of evolution. The interlinkages between the plant holobiont components are explored here in the light of current ecological and evolutionary theories. Microbiome complexity and the rules of microbiotic community assemblage are not yet fully understood. It is suggested that the plant can modulate its microbiota to dynamically adjust to its environment. To better understand the level of plant dependence on the microbiotic components, the core microbiota need to be determined at different hierarchical scales of ecology while pan-microbiome analyses would improve characterization of the functions displayed.},

A reassembly model is proposed where bacterial families that are heat tolerant and have high growth rates significantly increase in relative abundance after heat disturbance, while temperature-sensitive and slow-growing bacteria have a disadvantage. The results also pointed to a potential role of slow-growing, heat-tolerant bacterial families from Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria phyla in plant disease protection. In conclusion, short heat disturbance of soil results in rearrangement of rhizobacterial communities and this is correlated with changes in the ecosystem service disease suppression.},

For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. abstract Community ecology is often perceived as a " mess, " given the seemingly vast number of processes that can underlie the many patterns of interest, and the apparent uniqueness of each study system. However, at the most general level, patterns in the composition and diversity of species—the subject matter of community ecology—are influenced by only four classes of process: selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal. Selection represents deterministic fitness differences among species, drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes. Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of their interactions, with a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing the material of community ecology according to this framework can clarify the essential similarities and differences among the many conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and it can also allow for the articulation of a very general theory of community dynamics: species are added to communities via speciation and dispersal, and the relative abundances of these species are then shaped by drift and selection, as well as ongoing dispersal, to drive community dynamics.},

Entomopathogenic (EF) and nematophagous fungi (NF) enter their hosts directly via the cuticle or natural openings, what makes them attractive agents for biological pest control. These fungi have been traditionally viewed simply as animal predators, but recent studies show that a considerable number of fungal pathogens of invertebrates have an endophytic phase in their life cycles. Several taxa of EF and NF have been identified as naturally occurring endophytes and could be artificially inoculated in agricultural plant species. In addition, symbioses with some endophytic species positively affect plant growth and resistance against fungal pathogens. These additional ecological roles give a new perspective to the study of these organisms, because they are part of tritrophic interactions where plants, invertebrates, and fungi are closely involved. Understanding fungal-plant, fungal-pest, fungal-pathogen, and fungal-plant-pest interactions, plus the role of fungal viruses, that infect EF, could lead to the development of novel integrated crop production and protection tools.},

  abstract = {16S ribosomal RNA currently represents the most important target of study in bacterial ecology. Its use for the description of bacterial diversity is, however, limited by the presence of variable copy numbers in bacterial genomes and sequence variation within closely related taxa or within a genome. Here we use the information from sequenced bacterial genomes to explore the variability of 16S rRNA sequences and copy numbers at various taxonomic levels and apply it to estimate bacterial genome and DNA abundances. In total, 7,081 16S rRNA sequences were in silico extracted from 1,690 available bacterial genomes (1-15 per genome). While there are several phyla containing low 16S rRNA copy numbers, in certain taxa, e.g., the Firmicutes and Gammaproteobacteria, the variation is large. Genome sizes are more conserved at all tested taxonomic levels than 16S rRNA copy numbers. Only a minority of bacterial genomes harbors identical 16S rRNA gene copies, and sequence diversity increases with increasing copy numbers. While certain taxa harbor dissimilar 16S rRNA genes, others contain sequences common to multiple species. Sequence identity clusters (often termed operational taxonomic units) thus provide an imperfect representation of bacterial taxa of a certain phylogenetic rank. We have demonstrated that the information on 16S rRNA copy numbers and genome sizes of genome-sequenced bacteria may be used as an estimate for the closest related taxon in an environmental dataset to calculate alternative estimates of the relative abundance of individual bacterial taxa in environmental samples. Using an example from forest soil, this procedure would increase the abundance estimates of Acidobacteria and decrease these of Firmicutes. Using the currently available information, alternative estimates of bacterial community composition may be obtained in this way if the variation of 16S rRNA copy numbers among bacteria is considered. © 2013 Větrovský and Baldrian.}

The aim of this study was to evaluate how two different asexual Epichloë species modulate the establishment of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in a wild forage grass under different soil fertilization levels. Methods: We performed a completely randomized 12-month-long field experiment to evaluate the effect of two B. auleticus-endophyte ecotypes and two soil fertilization levels on the colonization of AMF, in seedlings and adult plants. Plant biomass and reproductive tillers production were also measured. Results: The symbiosis, measured as the total extent of AM fungal colonization and frequency of arbuscules was significantly higher in Epichloë-infected plants and was not affected by fertilization either in seedlings or in adult plants. Plant biomass was increased by fertilization but no differences were observed due to the endophytic status. However, E+ plants produced more panicles than their E− counterparts. Conclusions: Our findings strongly support the hypothesis of positive association between Epichloë endophytes and AMF in wild grasses, making this model important for agronomic improvement. © 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland},

Despite increasing evidence that these cryptic fungal symbionts of plants mediate interactions with pathogens and herbivores, there remain basic questions regarding the extent to which dispersal limitation and host specificity might shape fungal endophyte community composition in rainforests. To assess the relative importance of spatial pattern and host specificity, we isolated fungi from a sample of mapped trees in lowland Papua New Guinea. Sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region were obtained for 2,079 fungal endophytes from three sites and clustered into molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) at 95\% similarity. Multivariate analyses suggest that host affinity plays a significant role in structuring endophyte community composition whereas there was no evidence of endophyte spatial pattern at the scale of tens to hundreds of meters. Differences in endophyte communities between sampled trees were weakly correlated with variation in foliar traits but not with tree species relatedness. The dominance of relatively few generalist endophytes and the presence of a large number of rare MOTUs was a consistent observation at three sites separated by hundreds of kilometers and regional turnover was low. Host specificity appears to play a relatively weak but more important role than dispersal limitation in shaping the distribution of fungal endophyte communities in New Guinea forests. Our results suggest that in the absence of strong ecological gradients and host turnover, beta diversity of endophyte communities could be low in large areas of contiguous forest.

A handful of insects, notably the well-recognized fungus-farming ants, termites and beetles, have developed advanced agriculture, which includes seeding new gardens with crop propagules, improving growth conditions and protecting and harvesting the fungal crop. More examples, which could be called 'proto-fungiculture', involve fewer adaptations, as exemplified by marine snails that farm intertidal fungi on marsh grass. Recent work has indicated that the solitary leaf-rolling weevil Euops chinensis (family Attelabidae) has a protofarming symbiosis with the mycangial fungus Penicillium herquei (family Trichocomaceae). In this study, we investigated how the weevils create cradles (leaf-rolls) for their offspring and protect the fungal garden. We describe new specialized structures and behaviors that E. chinensis females use for leaf-rolling and fungus inoculation. The fungus P. herquei produces the antibiotic (þ)-scleroder-olide in laboratory culture and in leaf-rolls, which can serve to inhibit microbial 'weeds' and pests, thus protecting the fungal garden against potential infection. The fungiculture of E. chinensis differs from other advanced insect fungiculture systems because female weevils do not continuously tend the inoculated microbe and do not depend nutritionally on the fungus. The defensive role of the cultivated fungus makes the attelabid weevils exceptional in 'proto-fungiculture' animals.}

Microorganisms played a role in the degradation or "weathering" of the oil from the Amoco Cadiz. After the spill, bacteria developed naturally to remove some but not all of the components of the oil. The effectiveness of microbial degradation, varies because of the complexity of the oil and the differing microbial responses in aerobic and anaerobic environments. The ecological consequences of oil spills are largely un-known. Some hydrocarbons in petroleum are toxic, result-ing in large mortalities following oil spills; some are carcinogenic. The fate of petroleum hydrocarbons after an oil spill or similar event is therefore a matter of some concern. Hydrocarbons are removed from polluted environments in several "natural" ways, such as evaporation and dissol-ution of the volatile and soluble components; photochemi-cal decomposition; and microbial biodegradation.

In parallel greenhouse experiments, rhizosphere and phyllosphere microbiota of con- and heterospecific hosts from four species were independently manipulated. In a third experiment, we tested the combined effects of soil and phyllosphere feedback under field conditions. We found that three of four species experienced weak negative PSF whereas, in contrast, all four species experienced strong negative PPFs. Field-based feedback estimates were highly negative for all four species, though variable in magnitude. Our results suggest that phyllosphere microbiota, like rhizosphere microbiota, can potentially mediate plant species coexistence via negative feedbacks.

  abstract = {In a 1-y study of vegetation harvested by the leaf-cutting ants, Atta colombica Guerin, daily harvesting activity of two nests was observed for 24 h at c. 1-wk intervals (colony I: June 1993-June 1994; colony II: February-June 1994) on Burro Colorado Island. The average daily quantity of green leaves harvested by colony I was higher during the wet season (11.4 m2 d-1) than during the dry season (9.0 m2d-1), but was highly variable between survey days. Total annual herbivory of green leaves was estimated to be 3,855 m2 foliage area for colony I and 1,707 m2 for colony II. Total dry weight of biomass harvested was higher in the dry season because most material collected during the wet season consisted of green leaves, while during the dry season, more than 50\% of the total collected biomass was non-green plant material (stipules of Ficus sp., fruits, seeds, and flower parts of a variety of other species) which represented c. one third (111 kg y-1) of the total annual intake (370 kg y-1) of plant material. Total daily biomass intake was negatively correlated with daytime rainfall. The peak of daily foraging was affected by timing and duration of rainfall events. Highest input rates normally occurred between 15:00 and 16:00 h (colony I). Dry weight and surface area of harvested leaf fragments differed between plant species, with thicker leaves generally being cut into smaller pieces. Significant linear correlations were found between total daily harvest of fragments and the respective harvesting rate at the maximum of daily activity. High correspondence was found between estimates using this relationship and the measured daily leaf harvest of four other Atta colonies and of two colonies reported in published literature. The use of this relationship as a research tool is discussed.},

The spectrum runs from quick to slow return on investments of nutrients and dry mass in leaves, and operates largely independently of growth form, plant functional type or biome. Categories along the spectrum would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale better than plant functional types, because functional types overlap substantially in their leaf traits. Overall, modulation of leaf traits and trait relationships by climate is surprisingly modest, although some striking and significant patterns can be seen. Reliable quantification of the leaf economics spectrum and its interaction with climate will prove valuable for modelling nutrient fluxes and vegetation boundaries under changing land-use and climate.}

  abstract = {Many natural ecosystems have been degraded because of human activities 1,2 and need to be restored so that biodiversity is protected. However, restoration can take decades and restor-ation activities are often unsuccessful 3 because of abiotic constraints (for example, eutrophication, acidification) and unfavourable biotic conditions (for example, competition or adverse soil community composition). A key question is what manageable factors prevent transition from degraded to restored ecosystems and what interventions are required for successful restoration 2,4 . Experiments have shown that the soil community is an important driver of plant community development 5–8 , suggesting that manipulation of the soil community is key to successful restoration of terrestrial ecosystems 3,9 . Here we examine a large-scale, six-year-old field experiment on ex-arable land and show that application of soil inocula not only promotes ecosystem restoration, but that different origins of soil inocula can steer the plant commu-nity development towards different target communities, varying from grassland to heathland vegetation. The impact of soil inoculation on plant and soil community composition was most pronounced when the topsoil layer was removed, whereas effects were less strong, but still significant, when the soil inocula were introduced into intact topsoil. Therefore, soil inoculation is a powerful tool to both restore disturbed terrestrial ecosystems and steer plant community development. Plants and their associated soil communities are tightly inter-linked and influence each other during successional changes in developing ecosystems 10,11 . Several studies with grassland plant communities have shown that inoculation with late-successional soil communities can increase the performance of late-successional target plant species, at the expense of early-successional ruderals 6–8,11 . This suggests that through inoculation with late-successional soils the typically positive feedback 6,11 between late-successional plants and their soil organisms may be restored 9}

Two hundred ninety-five isolates were classified into 38 taxa by morphological characteristics. The representative 38 isolates from each taxa were selected for further molecular identification using nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences, including both the internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) and the 5.8S gene region. The 38 representative endophytes were identified to various taxonomic levels. These results suggest that Pestalotiopsis and Phomopsis were the most frequent endophytes in the four host species. Some of the endophytes exhibit host and tissue specificity. The colonization frequencies of endophytic fungi in the stems of the four host plants are evidently higher than in the roots.

Current pre-dictions for long-term symbiont prevalence are based on their fitness benefits and vertical transmission rates but ignore nonlinear compet-itive feedbacks among symbiotic and symbiont-free hosts. We hy-pothesized that such feedbacks function as stabilizing mechanisms, promoting coexistence of host types and maintaining intermediate symbiont frequency at the population scale. Using a model grass/en-dophyte symbiosis, we manipulated competition within and between endophyte-symbiotic (Eϩ) and endophyte-free (EϪ) hosts and fit competition models to experimental data. We show for the first time that symbiont-structured competition can generate stable coexistence of Eϩ and EϪ hosts, even under perfect vertical transmission. Niche differentiation was the key to coexistence, causing hosts of each type to limit themselves more strongly than each other. These results es-tablish roles for nonlinear competitive dynamics and niche differen-tiation in the ecology and evolution of heritable symbionts.},

A detailed PKS domain analysis confirmed the stereochemical integrity of the divergolides and provided valuable new insights into the formation of the diverse aromatic chromophores. The bioinformatic analyses and the isolation and full structural elucidation of four new divergolide congeners led to a revised biosynthetic model that illustrates the formation of four different types of ansamycin chromophores from a single polyketide precursor.}

Such programmes would be most effective if the fungi grew systemically through their hosts. To date, evidence for systemic growth is equivocal and the aim of this study was to determine whether systemic growth occurs, through a detailed study of endophytes in one host plant species. We isolated a number of endophytes from the forb Silene dioica and examined fungal interactions in dual culture. We found very little evidence for any systemic growth within leaves and none within plants. Antagonistic interactions between fungi were extremely common, suggesting that any systemic effects of these fungi on other organisms are likely to be due to chemical movement, not fungal growth.},

However, differences in the community and network structures of phyllosphere epiphytic and endophytic fungi are currently poorly documented. In this study, we examined epiphytic and endophytic fungal communities associated with the leaves of six mangrove species using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequences. Results: A total of 635 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of endophytic and epiphytic fungi were obtained at a 97\% sequence similarity level; they were dominated by Dothideomycetes and Tremellomycetes. Plant identity had a significant effect on the OTU richness of endophytic fungi, but not on epiphytic fungi. The community composition of epiphytic and endophytic fungi was significantly different, and plant identity had a greater effect on endophytic fungi than on epiphytic fungi. Network analysis showed that both epiphytic and endophytic network structures were characterized by significantly highly specialized and modular but lowly connected and anti-nested properties. Furthermore, the endophytic network had higher levels of specialization and modularity but lower connectance and stronger anti-nestedness than the epiphytic network. Conclusions: This study reveals that the phyllosphere epiphytic and endophytic fungal communities differ, and plant identity has a greater effect on the endophytic fungi than on epiphytic fungi. These findings demonstrate the role of host plant identity in driving phyllosphere epiphytic and endophytic community structure.},

Classical examples of symbiotic microbes are mycorrhizal fungi that aid in the uptake of water and minerals, and Rhizobium bacteria that fix atmospheric nitrogen for the plant. Several other types of beneficial soilborne microbes, such as plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria and fungi with biological control activity, can stimulate plant growth by directly suppressing deleterious soilborne pathogens or by priming aboveground plant parts for enhanced defense against foliar pathogens or insect herbivores. The establishment of beneficial associations requires mutual recognition and substantial coordination of plant and microbial responses. A growing body of evidence suggests that beneficial microbes are initially recognized as potential invaders, after which an immune response is triggered, whereas, at later stages of the interaction, mutualists are able to shortcircuit plant defense responses to enable successful colonization of host roots. Here, we review our current understanding of how symbiotic and nonsymbiotic beneficial soil microbes modulate the plant immune system and discuss the role of local and systemic defense responses in establishing the delicate balance between the two partners. © 2012 The American Phytopathological Society.}

However, microbial community structure varies in different spatial and temporal scales and none of the 'omic techniques are individually able to elucidate the complex aspects of microbial communities and ecosystems.

In this study, the spatial and temporal dynamics of the bacterial communities associated with grapevine organs (leaves, flowers, grapes, and roots) and soils were characterized over two growing seasons to determine the influence of vine cultivar, edaphic parameters, vine developmental stage (dormancy, flowering, preharvest), and vineyard. Belowground bacterial communities differed significantly from those aboveground, and yet the communities associated with leaves, flowers, and grapes shared a greater proportion of taxa with soil communities than with each other, suggesting that soil may serve as a bacterial reservoir. A subset of soil microorganisms, including root colonizers significantly enriched in plant growth-promoting bacteria and related functional genes, were selected by the grapevine. In addition to plant selective pressure, the structure of soil and root microbiota was significantly influenced by soil pH and C:N ratio, and changes in leaf- and grape-associated microbiota were correlated with soil carbon and showed interannual variation even at small spatial scales. Diazotrophic bacteria, e.g., Rhizobiaceae and Bradyrhizobium spp., were significantly more abundant in soil samples and root samples of specific vineyards. Vine-associated microbial assemblages were influenced by myriad factors that shape their composition and structure, but the majority of organ-associated taxa originated in the soil, and their distribution reflected the influence of highly localized biogeographic factors and vineyard management.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nIMPORTANCE: Vine-associated bacterial communities may play specific roles in the productivity and disease resistance of their host plant. Also, the bacterial communities on grapes have the potential to influence the organoleptic properties of the wine, contributing to a regional terroir. Understanding that factors that influence these bacteria may provide insights into management practices to shape and craft individual wine properties. We show that soil serves as a key source of vine-associated bacteria and that edaphic factors and vineyard-specific properties can influence the native grapevine microbiome preharvest.}

We compared marsh periwinkle (Littoraria irrorata) density and shell length at salt marsh sites with heavy oiling to reference conditions ∼16 months after oiling. We also compared periwinkle density and size among oiled sites with and without shoreline cleanup treatments. Densities of periwinkles were reduced by 80-90\% at the oiled marsh edge and by 50\% in the oiled marsh interior (∼9 m inland) compared to reference, with greatest numerical losses of periwinkles in the marsh interior, where densities were naturally higher. Shoreline cleanup further reduced adult snail density as well as snail size. Based on the size of adult periwinkles observed coupled with age and growth information, population recovery is projected to take several years once oiling and habitat conditions in affected areas are suitable to support normal periwinkle life-history functions. Where heavily oiled marshes have experienced accelerated erosion as a result of the spill, these habitat impacts would represent additional losses of periwinkles. Losses of marsh periwinkles would likely affect other ecosystem processes and attributes, including organic matter and nutrient cycling, marsh-estuarine food chains, and multiple species that prey on periwinkles. © 2015 American Chemical Society.}

However, little is known about the contribution of NSC to tree economics, and in particular, whether leaf, stem and coarse root traits co‐ordinate together into a whole‐tree economics spectrum.                                                     Twenty‐four functional traits (including NSC content) were measured in leaves, stem and coarse root xylem of up to 90 angiosperm tree species in temperate, Mediterranean and tropical climates. By performing principal component analysis and standardized major axis regression, we explored the relationships between NSC and other functional traits, as well as the effects of climate and phylogeny on these relationships.                                                     Our results revealed a covariation between leaf and coarse root NSC content and leaf economic traits, whereas stem NSC content was largely decoupled from the leaf economics spectrum that was mostly driven by leaf nitrogen content and leaf mass per area. Coarse root xylem traits were closely correlated with leaf traits, while most stem xylem traits were independent from the leaf economics spectrum but covaried with coarse root traits. Trade‐offs among traits in tropical species opposed those from other climates. Evolutionary history affected relationships among certain traits but did not change overall patterns.                                                     We conclude that due to leaf habit, an extended growing season and heightened defences, tropical species form distinct conservative resource acquisition strategies. Across all climates, as the stem must provide an efficient transport route between roots and leaves, while maintaining the display of branch and leaf organs, stem xylem design and NSC storage capacity lead to a stem economics spectrum that is largely independent from the leaf spectrum, but is coupled with that of coarse roots due to anatomical continuity.

We tested both single strain and bacteria consortia for their ability to degrade weathered crude oil, over 25 days, and found the single strain Pseudomonas putida (P. putida) exhibited the best performance for degrading all alkanes from C14 to C32 and 61.01\% of the Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPHs), but bacterial consortia did not degrade as much of the n-alkanes as the single strain, with TPHs degradation ranging from 28.4\% to 51.5\%. This is the first time the endophyte P. putida has been shown to improve the degradation of crude oil, demonstrating the potential of this strain to benefit biological remediation. We did not find any correlation between bio-surfactant production and oil degradation.},

  author = {Zhou, Wenqing and Starr, James L and Krumm, Janice L and Sword, Gregory A},
  url = {http://swordlab.tamu.edu},
  abstract = {Mutualistic plant-endophyte symbioses can benefit plants by increasing host fitness through reductions in herbivory. The fungus, Chaetomium globosum strain TAMU 520, was previously isolated as an endophyte from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) and can be re-inoculated to systemically colonize cotton plants via seed treatment. We evaluated the potential impacts of the endophyte in cotton on plant parasitic nematodes belowground, along with piercing-sucking and chewing insects aboveground. Endophytic C. globosum inhibited root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) infection and reduced female reproduction belowground. To confirm the endophytic effect of C. globosum on root-knot nematode, a contact fungicide was applied to remove soil-borne and epiphytic C. globosum. Consistent inhibition of nematode activity was observed post-fungicide treatment, with positive C. globosum colonization confirmed within plant tissues. Aboveground, endophytic C. globosum also negatively affected the fecundity of both cotton aphids (Aphis gossypii) and beet armyworms (Spodoptera exigua). Faster development rates and smaller head capsule of beet armyworm larvae were observed when fed Chaetomium-colonized plants. However, no larval weight difference was found between Chaetomium-colonized and control plants. No consistent effect on plant performance was found across experiments. Our findings illustrate how a single facultative fungal endophyte can increase plant systemic resistance against a range of invertebrate herbivores in a major crop.}

  abstract = {Mangrove endophytic fungi can produce impressive quantities of metabolites with promising antioxidant activities that may be useful to humans as novel physiological agents. In this study, we investigated the phylogenetic diversity and antioxidant potential of 46 fungal endophytes derived from the mangrove species Rhizophora stylosa and R. mucronata from the South China Sea. The fungal isolates were identified using a combination of morphological characteristics and phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. Seventeen genera belonging to 8 taxonomic orders of Ascomycota were discovered, specifically, Botryosphaeriales, Capnodiales, Diaporthales, Eurotiales, Glomerellales, Hypocreales, Pleosporales, and Xylariales. The most abundant fungal orders included Xylariales (35.49\%) and Diaporthales (27.61\%), which were predominantly represented by the culturable species Pestalotiopsis sp. (34.54\%) and Diaporthe sp. (18.62\%). The stems showed more frequent colonization and species diversity than the roots, leaves, hypocotyls, and flower tissues of the host plant. The antioxidant activities of all the isolated fungal extracts on four different culture media were assessed using improved 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonicacid) (ABTS) methods. A relatively high proportion (84.8\%) of the isolates displayed antioxidant capacity (\%RSA {$>$} 50\%). Further research also provided the first evidence that HOD-6 could produce flufuran as a significant radical scavenger with IC50 values of 34.85 +/- 1.56 and 9.75 +/- 0.58 mu g/mL, respectively. Our findings suggest that the utilization of a biotope such as that of the endophytic fungal community thriving on the mangrove plants R. stylosa and R. mucronata may be suitable for use as a sustainable resource for natural antioxidants.}

  title = {The Importance of Stupidity in Scientific Research},
  doi = {10.1242/jcs.033340},
  abstract = {I recently saw an old friend for the first time in many years. We had been Ph.D. students at the same time, both studying science, although in different areas. She later dropped out of graduate school, went to Harvard Law School and is now a senior lawyer for a major environmental organization. At some point, the conversation turned to why she had left graduate school. To my utter astonishment, she said it was because it made her feel stupid. After a couple of years of feeling stupid every day, she was ready to do something else. I had thought of her as one of the brightest people I knew and her subsequent career supports that view. What she said bothered me. I kept thinking about it; sometime the next day, it hit me. Science makes me feel stupid too. It's just that I've gotten used to it. So used to it, in fact, that I actively seek out new opportunities to feel stupid. I wouldn't know what to do without that feeling. I even think it's supposed to be this way. Let me explain. For almost all of us, one of the reasons that we liked science in high school and college is that we were good at it. That can't be the only reason – fascination with understanding the physical world and an emotional need to discover new things has to enter into it too. But high-school and college science means taking courses, and doing well in courses means getting the right answers on tests. If you know those answers, you do well and get to feel smart. A Ph.D., in which you have to do a research project, is a whole different thing. For me, it was a daunting task. How could I possibly frame the questions that would lead to significant discoveries; design and interpret an experiment so that the conclusions were absolutely convincing; foresee difficulties and see ways around them, or, failing that, solve them when they occurred? My Ph.D. project was somewhat interdisciplinary and, for a while, whenever I ran into a problem, I pestered the faculty in my department who were experts in the various disciplines that I needed. I remember the day when Henry Taube (who won the Nobel Prize two years later) told me he didn't know how to solve the problem I was having in his area. I was a third-year graduate student and I figured that Taube knew about 1000 times more than I did (conservative estimate). If he didn't have the answer, nobody did. That's when it hit me: nobody did. That's why it was a research problem. And being my research problem, it was up to me to solve. Once I faced that fact, I solved the problem in a couple of days. (It wasn't really very hard; I just had to try a few things.) The crucial lesson was that the scope of things I didn't know wasn't merely vast; it was, for all practical purposes, infinite. That realization, instead of being discouraging, was liberating. If our ignorance is infinite, the only possible course of action is to muddle through as best we can. I'd like to suggest that our Ph.D. programs often do students a disservice in two ways. First, I don't think students are made to understand how hard it is to do research. And how very, very hard it is to do important research. It's a lot harder than taking even very demanding courses. What makes it difficult is that research is immersion in the unknown. We just don't know what we're doing. We can't be sure whether we're asking the right question or doing the right experiment until we get the answer or the result. Admittedly, science is made harder by competition for grants and space in top journals. But apart from all of that, doing significant research is intrinsically hard and changing departmental, institutional or national policies will not succeed in lessening its intrinsic difficulty. Second, we don't do a good enough job of teaching our students how to be productively stupid – that is, if we don't feel stupid it means we're not really trying. I'm not talking about 'relative stupidity', in which the other students in the class actually read the material, think about it and ace the exam, whereas you don't. I'm also not talking about bright people who might be working in areas that don't match their talents. Science involves confronting our 'absolute stupidity'. That kind of stupidity is an existential fact, inherent in our efforts to push our way into the unknown. Preliminary and thesis exams have the right idea when the faculty committee pushes until the student starts getting the answers wrong or gives up and says, 'I don't know'. The point of the exam isn't to see if the student gets all the answers right. If they do, it's the faculty who failed the exam. The point is to identify the student's weaknesses, partly to see where they need to invest some effort and partly to see whether the student's knowledge fails at a sufficiently high level that they are ready to take on a research project. Productive stupidity means being ignorant by choice. Focusing on important questions puts us in the awkward position of being ignorant. One of the beautiful things about science is that it allows us to bumble along, getting it wrong time after time, and feel perfectly fine as long as we learn something each time. No doubt, this can be difficult for students who are accustomed to getting the answers right. No doubt, reasonable levels of confidence and emotional resilience help, but I think scientific education might do more to ease what is a very big transition: from learning what other people once discovered to making your own discoveries. The more comfortable we become with being stupid, the deeper we will wade into the unknown and the more likely we are to make big discoveries.}

As knowledge of ecological interactions between flowers and their microbial communities (the anthosphere) expands, it becomes increasingly important to consider the evolutionary impacts of these associations and their potential eco-evolutionary dynamics. In this Viewpoint we synthesize current knowledge of the anthosphere within a multilevel selection framework and illustrate the potential for the extended floral phenotype (the phenotype expressed from the genes of the plant and its associated flower microbes) to evolve. We argue that flower microbes are an important, but understudied, axis of variation that shape floral trait evolution and angiosperm reproductive ecology. We highlight knowledge gaps and discuss approaches that are critical for gaining a deeper understanding of the role microbes play in mediating plant reproduction, ecology, and evolution.}

  title = {Smooth {{Cordgrass Propagation Guide}} 1 {{Seed Collection}}},
  abstract = {Observe inflorescence development of Spartina alterniflora in the field. In coastal Mississippi and along the northern Gulf of Mexico this generally starts in late September. Spikelets usually mature and are ready for collecting in late November (Eleuterius and Caldwell 1984); however, this may vary from year to year depending on weather conditions. The inflorescence of Spartina alterniflora is a panicle (a branched cluster of flowers) composed of appressed and overlapping spikes. Each spike consists of many (10-40) smaller spikelets. The mature spikelets are light brown and may appear slightly dried out. Inside some of the mature spikelets is a small brownish dry fruit (caryopsis) that contains a single seed. Spikelets are best harvested by stripping them from the inflorescence by hand and collecting them into plastic bags. The spikelets must be collected within two to three weeks of maturation (no later than end of December). Mature spikelets will naturally fall off the inflorescence, especially during periods of high wind associated with cold fronts. Also try to avoid areas that are heavily infected with the ergot fungus (Claviceps purpurea) or where birds have eaten the seeds. Not all inflorescences mature at the same time. Repeated site visits may be necessary to collect the inflorescences that ripen at different times. 2 Seed Preparation The Spartina alterniflora spikelets (which contain the seeds) must be processed as quickly as possible after collection, preferably on the same day. Spartina alterniflora seeds are very susceptible to drying out. If the moisture content of the seed falls below 40\%, then the seeds will not germinate (Cohn and Chappell 2007). The collected spikelets are cleaned of debris (insects, plant material, fungal-infected seeds) by sieving the seeds through a U.S.A. Standard Test Sieve No.10 (2 mm mesh size) to remove the larger pieces of undesirable material. Then small amounts of the sieved spikelets are spread out on white paper and the remaining undesirable material is removed with forceps (tweezers). This is a very time-consuming process, but essential to the successful storage conditions of the seeds. There are an estimated 230,000 seeds per pound dry weight (CPR unpublished data). 3 Seed Storage}
