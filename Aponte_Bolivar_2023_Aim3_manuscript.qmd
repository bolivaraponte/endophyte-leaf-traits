# Abstract

# Introduction

# Methods

## Field

Growth and host plant inoculation seven tropical tree species was
conducted at the greenhouses in the Gamboa Research Station, Smithsonian
Tropical Research institute, Republic of Panama. The species, *Theobroma
cacao*, *Dypterix* sp., *Lacmellea panamensis*, *Apeiba membranacea*,
*Heisteria concinna*, *Chrysophyllum caimito*, and *Cordia alliodora*
were chosen due to their variance in leaf traits (J.Wright unpublished
data) and the availability of seeds in January- April 2019. Seeds of
tree species were collected from the forest floor and grown in the
greenhouse. Seedlings were kept in a chamber made out of PVC and clear
plastic to prevent inoculation from spore fall inside the
greenhouse. NEEDS INFORMATION ON THE SOIL MIXTURE AND AUTOCLAVING
PROTOCOL. Seedlings reached a minimum of 4 true leaves before endophyte
inoculation. Then 10 individual plants of each species were exposed to
10 nights of spore fall to achieve a high endophyte load (E+) and 10
homologous plants were kept inside the greenhouse plastic chamber to
maintain a low endophyte load (E-) (Fig. ? MAKE A DIRAGRAM?). Plants
exposed to spore fall were placed near (\~10 m) the forest edge at dusk
(\~18:OO hours) and returned to the greenhouse at dawn (\~07:00 hours)
(Bittleston et al. 2011).

### Leaf trait measurements

Three mature leaves were haphazardly collected from each of the
individual plants in each treatment (E+, E-) within 7-10 days after
inoculation treatment. Anthocyanin content and leaf thickness were
measured while the leaf was still attached to the plant. We measured
anthocyanin content with ACM-200plus (Opti-Sciences Inc. Hudson, New
Hampshire, U.S.A.) on three haphazardly selected locations (working from
the petiole out to the leaf tip) on the leaf surface of three
haphazardly selected leaves for a total of nine measurements per plant
[@tellezTraits2022]. The ACM-200 calculates an anthocyanin content index
(ACI) value from the ratio of % transmittance at 931 nm/% transmittance
at 525 nm [@tellezRedCol2016, CITE COMPANY] . On compound leaves (i.e.,
*Dypterix* sp.) we measured at three different leaflets. Leaf thickness
was measured with METER MODEL HERE following the same manner as the
anthocyanin measurements. After anthocyanin and leaf thickness
measurements were completed, we removed the leaves from their stems,
placed them inside a plastic bag (i.e. ZiplocⓇ), place in an ice chest
and moved them to the lab for further measurements. Leaf toughness was
measured with METER MODEL HERE following PROTOCOL XXXX (or measurements
were taken by puncturing a 2 mm diameter hole in various locations on
the leaf surface. We punctured the leaf lamina at the base, mid-leaf and
tip on both sides of the mid-vein, avoiding minor leaf veins when
possible (CITE). Once leaf toughness was measured, we used a 7 mm
diameter punch hole to puncture disks for leaf mass per area (LMA)
measurements. We collected one three disks per leaf (see S? material for
details). The disk punches dried at 60 °C for 48-72 hours. before being
weighed.

### Leaf tissue preparation for molecular work

The selected leaves were also used to profile endophyte community
composition, abundance, and richness via amplicon sequencing (Illumina
MiSeq). The leaf tissue remaining after the leaf trait measurements had
the main vein and margins excised so that only the lamina remained. The
lamina was haphazardly cut into 2 x 2 mm segments, enough to obtain a
total of 16, and surface sterilized by sequential rinsing in 95% ethanol
(10 s), 0.5 NaOCl (2 mins) and 70% ethanol (2 mins), as per
[@arnold2003; @higgins2014; @tellezTraits2022]. After, leaves were
air-dried briefly under sterile conditions. Sixteen leaf segments per
leaf, a total of forty-eight leaf segments per plant, were plated in 2%
malt extract agar (MEA), sealed with Parafilm M (Bemis Company Inc.,
U.S.A.) and incubated at room temperature. The cultured leaf segments
were used to estimate endophyte colonization of E+ and E- leaves. The
presence or absence of endophytic fungi in the leaf cuttings was
assessed 7 days after plating. The remaining sterilized leaf lamina was
preserved in sterile 15 mL tubes with \~ 10 mL CTAB solution (1 M
Tris--HCl pH 8, 5 M NaCl, 0.5 M EDTA, and 20 g CTAB). Leaf tissue in
CTAB solution was used for amplicon sequencing (described in detail
below). All leaf tissue handling was performed in a biosafety cabinet
with all surfaces sterilized by exposure to UV light for 30 minutes and
cleaned sequentially in between samples with 95% ethanol, 0.5% NaOCl and
70% ethanol to prevent cross contamination.

## Amplicon sequencing

Leaf tissue in CTBA solution was stored for 2 months at room temperature
prior to being placed at -80 C for 3 months before extracting DNA. In
preparation for DNA extraction, we decontaminated all instruments,
materials, and surfaces with DNAway (Molecular BioProducts Inc., San
Diego, CA, United States), 95% Ethanol, 0.5 % NaOCl, and 70 % Ethanol,
and subsequently treated with UV light for 30 minutes in biosafety
cabinet. We then transferred 0.2 -- 0.3 g of leaf tissue into duplicate
sterile 2mL tubes, resulting in 2 subsamples. Total genomic DNA from
subsamples was extracted as described in U'Ren & Arnold [-@uren2017]. In
brief, added two sterile 3.2 mm stainless steel beads to each tube and
proceeded to lyophilize samples for 72 hours to fully remove CTAB
content from tissue. After this period, we submerged the sample tubes in
liquid nitrogen for 30s and proceeded to homogenize samples to a fine
powder for 45 s in FastPrep-24 Tissue and Cell Homogenizer (MP
Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA). Afterwards, we repeated the
decontamination procedure described before and used QIAGEN DNeasy 96
PowerPlant Pro-HTP Kit [@uren2017] (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA,
USA). After all genomic DNA was extracted, we pooled the subsamples for
each individual sample before amplification. We used sterile equipment
and pipettes with aerosol-resistant tips with filters in all steps
before amplification. We followed a two-step amplification approach
previously described by Sarmiento et al. [-@sarmiento2017] and U´Ren &
Arnold [-@uren2017]. We used primers for the fungal ITSrDNA region,
ITS1f (5'-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA-3') and ITS4
(5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3') with modified universal consensus sequences
CS1 and CS2 and 0--5 bp for phase-shifting. Every sample was amplified
in two parallel reactions containing 1-2 µL of DNA template [@uren2017; see also @tellezTraits2022]. We visualized PCR (PCR1)
reactions with SYBR Green 1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) on 2%
agarose gel [@oita2021]. Based on the electrophoresis band
intensity, we combined parallel PCR1 reactions and diluted 5 µL of
amplicon product with molecular grade water to standardize to a
concentration of 1:15 [@tellezTraits2022; @sarmiento2017 for details]. We
included DNA extraction blanks and PCR1 negatives in this step. We used
a separate set of sterile pipettes, tips, and equipment to reduce
contamination. We used a designated PCR area to restrict contact with
pre-PCR materials [@oita2021].\

We used 1 µL of PCR1 product from samples and negative control for a
second PCR (PCR2) with barcode adapters (IBEST Genomics Resource Core,
Moscow, ID, USA). Each PCR2 reaction (total 15 µL) contained 1X Phusion
Flash High Fidelity PCR Master Mix, 0.075 µM of barcoded primers
(forward and reverse pooled at a concentration of 2 µM) and 0.24mg/mL of
BSA following [@sarmiento2017; @uren2017]. Before final pooling for
sequencing, we purified the amplicons using Agencourt AMPure XP Beads
(Beckman Coulter Inc, Brea, CA USA) to a ratio of 1:1 following the
manufacturer's instructions. The products were evaluated with Bio
Analyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) ([Tellez et
al 2022) @tellezTraits2022]. We quantified the samples through University of
Arizona Genetics Core, and subsequently diluted them to the same
concentration to prevent over representation of samples with higher
concentration, see (CITATION). Amplicons were normalized to 1 ng/µL,
then pooled 2 µL of each for sequencing. No contamination was detected
visually or by fluorometric analysis. To provide robust controls we
combined 5 µL of each PCR1 negative and the DNA extraction blanks and
sequenced them as samples. Ultimately, we combined samples into a single
tube with 20 ng/µL of amplified DNA with barcoded adapters for
sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform with Reagent Kit v3 (2 × 300
bp) following protocols from the IBEST Genomics Resource Core at the
University of Idaho, USA. Again, we included the DNA extraction blanks
and two PCR1 negatives and sequenced with samples. Sequencing yielded
3,778,081 total ITS1 reads.

### Mock Communities

We processed and sequenced two mock communities following the methods
described above. This allowed us to assess the quality of our NGS data
set. We used two mock communities that consisted of PCR product from DNA
extractions of 31 phylogenetically distinct fungi, representing lineages
that are typically observed as endophytes [@oita2021; see @daru2019 for
details]. In brief, we used a mock community with equimolar
concentrations of DNA from all 31 fungal taxa and a second mock
community with tiered concentrations of DNA from the same fungal taxa
[@daru2019]. Each mock community was sequenced five times (i.e., five
replicates) [@oita2021]. The read abundance from the tiered community
was positively associated with the expected read number (with replicate
as a random factor: R2Adj = 0.87, P = XXXX, see Supplementary material).
Accordingly, we used read abundance as a relevant proxy for biological
abundance (Taylor et al. 2016; U'Ren et al. 2019)



### Bioinformatic analyses

We used VSEARCH (v2.14.1) for *de novo* chimera detection, dereplication and sequence alignment. VSEARCH is an open-source alternative to USEARCH that uses an optimal global aligner (full dynamic programming Needleman-Wunsch), resulting in more accurate alignments and sensitivity [@rognes2016]. We used forward reads (ITS1) for downstream bioinformatics analyses due to their high quality, rather than reverse reads (ITS4). Following Sarmiento et al. [-@sarmiento2017], we concatenated all reads in a single file and used FastQC (CITATION) to assess Phred scores above 30 to determine and adequate length of truncation in post-sequencing quality control. READNUMBER OF THAT FILE. We truncated reads to a length of 250 bp with command `fast_trunclen` and filtered them at a maximum
expected error of 1.0 with command `fast_maxee`. The result was XXXX total reads after sequencing quality
control. We clustered unique sequence zero radius OTUs (zOTU), by using commands `derep_fulllength` and `minseqlength` set at 2. Sequentially we denoised and removed chimeras from read sequences with commands `cluster_unoise`,  and `uchime3_denovo`, respectively (see Supplementary YYY for details). After which, GGGGG number of read sequences remained. Finally, we clustered zOTUs at a 95% sequence similarity with command `usearch_global` and option `id` set at 0.95. 
 Taxonomy was assigned with the Tree-Based Alignment Selector Toolkit [@carbone2019] by placing unknowns within the Pezizomycotina v2 reference tree [@carbone2017]. ITS sequences were blasted against the UNITE database by the ribosomal database project (RDP) classifier. Only OTUs representing Ascomycota were used for dowstream statistical analyses since foliar endoophyte communities in tropical trees are dominated by Ascomycota [@arnold2007]. in our data the total OTUs with BLAST hits are composed of FFFF% Ascomycota, GGG% Basidiomycota, etc etc.

### Ant-endophyte interaction assays

A fresh fourth leaf was used in ant assays. To assess leaf-cutter ant damage, we introduced one detached
leaf per plant per treatment to an actively foraging leaf-cutter ant
colony for a two-hour assay. We presented leaf-cutter ant colonies with
a choice of an E+ or an E- leaf on a disposable plastic plate next to an
active nest trail. Carefully, we collected and placed debris from the
trail leading up to the plate to lure ants into the plate. We initiated
the ant assay as soon as an ant entered the plate and explored the
leaf contents (for \~ 10-20 seconds). Every five minutes we took a
digital photo of the choice arena until about 75% of the leaf content of
one of the leaves was consumed. We used the digital photo at time zero
and at the end of trial to quantify the leaf area removed using ImageJ
(VERSION?). Ant recruitment was estimated by counting individuals in
choice arena throughout trial event. 

### Pathogen assays 

For the pathogen assays, we introduced an agar plug inoculated with hyphae of *Calonectria* sp. (P+ treatment), and an agar plug without the pathogen (P- control)
to similarly aged/sized leaves within 10-14 days after endophyte inoculations. Leaves
with the $P+$ or $P-$  treatment were misted with sterile water two times a
day (morning and afternoon) to maintain moisture. After four days, we
removed the plugs and took digital photos to analyze leaf area damage
using ImageJ (CITE).


### Statistical Analyses 

we used a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) for the all the
tree species using the "manova" function in the "stats" package in R
(The R Core Team, 2013). A MANOVA allows for an analysis of variance
with two or more covariates (i.e., endophyte load (E_load ) and tree
species)) and multiple dependent variables (i.e., ACI, LMA, Thickness,
Toughness). With the "summary.aov" function and argument "split" set to
"list ("E_load:Species")" I determined how independent variables, E_load
and tree species, influenced variance of my covariates: Thickness,
Toughness, LMA, and ACI. I computed Wilk's tests statistic for MANOVA
where in the closer to zero the statistic is, the variable in question
contributes more to the model, hence we reject the null hypothesis if
zero. Additionally, to determine which interactions of E_load and tree
species are significant in regard to abundance, I performed two way
ANOVAs using "aov" function and post-hoc Tukey tests using "TukeyHSD"
function in the "stats' package in R (The R Core Team, 2013). This
allows for a more in-depth look at interactions between and among
groups, not necessarily apparent from MANOVA tests.

To test for H2, I used a general linear mixed model (GLM). First, to
determine which fixed effects to include in my model I created a
correlation matrix with "cor()" function in R statistical software.
Covariates (Thickness, Toughness, LMA, ACI, E_load, and Tree Species)
with correlation coefficients greater than 0.25 were not included in
linear model analyses. Secondly, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was
used to determine underlying interactions among covariates that could
influence fungal endophyte abundance in seedlings (hereafter,
abundance). The PCA was computed using the "prcomp" function in R
statistical software (The R Core Team, 2013). The PCA was computed using
the following covariates: Thickness, Toughness, LMA, and ACI, to test
the effect of ACI, Species, Toughness, Thickness, LMA, endophyte load
(E_load) as my independent variables (fixed effects) on the abundance of
endophytes, dependent variable. The PCA was used to inform which
covariates to include in linear model analyses. From PCA and correlation
analysis, Thickness, Toughness and E_load were chosen to compute an
initial linear model with interaction. Linear model was computed using
"lm" function from the "stats" package in R (The R Core Team, 2013). I
selected the best fit model using "stepAIC" function in the "MASS"
package with "direction" argument set to "both" for backward and forward
selection (The R Core Team, 2013). The best fit model was achieved when
all covariates had a significant P-value. Results Results support my
first hypothesis: H1) endophyte abundance will be significantly
different across tree species and endophyte treatments. The results from
the MANOVA for E_load (p-value \< 0.0001), Species (p-value \< 0.0001)
and the interaction between E_load and Species (P-value \< 0.0001)
support this hypothesis, with a Wilk's test statistic of 0.44, 0.02, and
0.75 respectively, hence the null hypothesis is rejected (Fig. 2 and 3).
Multiple interactions between endophyte abundance and endophyte
treatment and tree species were significantly different. A two-way ANOVA
and post-hoc Tukey test of these interactions show in detail which
interaction between and among groups are significant (see Table 4 in
supplementary materials).

Principal Component Analysis revealed how covariates (LMA, ACI,
Thickness and Toughness) interact. I overlapped tree species groups on
the PCA axes to show how the variance in the data is explained by PC1
(60%) and PC2 (27%) (Fig. 4). This is indicative of correlation among
covariates. Thickness and toughness were orthogonal to each other in
PCA, indicative of low correlation. Correlation analysis revealed that
these covariates were negatively correlated to each other (r = -0.12).
Additionally, both Toughness and Thickess had the greatest loadings on
PC1 and PC2, respectively (Fig. 4).

The best fit model that resulted from using "stepAIC" function includes
Toughness and E_load as fixed effects as well as their interaction
effect (F-statistic=180.6, df = 463, p-value: \< 2.2e-16). The AIC value
for the best fit model is -108.1. I did not include in further analyses
covariates that were above the 0.25 correlation cut-off established (see
Table 1 in supplementary materials). Finally, two equations resulted
from the multivariate regression analysis of the best fit model: for E-
plants and for E+ plants (Fig. 5). Plants exposed E+ treatment have a
negative correlation with leaf toughness. That is, as Toughness
increased endophyte abundance decreased. Plants exposed to E- treatment
had a negative correlation as well, albeit the slope of the line was not
as steep (Fig. 5). No random effects were modeled.
